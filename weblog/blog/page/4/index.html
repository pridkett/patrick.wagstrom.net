  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m officially on the hook for competing in <a href="http://kevinhaugh.blogspot.com/2008/03/iron-april-2008-athletes.html">Iron April 2009</a>.  It&#8217;s an interesting event organized by a real Ironman, <a href="http://kevinhaugh.blogspot.com/">Kevin Haugh</a>, that takes loads of folks who normally don&#8217;t triathalons and convinces them to do the distance of an Ironman over the course of the month of April.  It&#8217;s an informal sort of competition where you&#8217;re motivated by the other folks who are also trying to accomplish the same thing.  There&#8217;s not prize for being the first person to finish, other than knowing that you managed to complete Iron April.  Each person has a page where they post their updates and progress.  I&#8217;ll be posting little short blurbs <a href="http://kevinhaugh.blogspot.com/2005/01/patrick-wagstrom.html">here</a>.  In addition, sometime soon I&#8217;ll also create some sort of widget that I can use to post my overall progress on the sidebar of the blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly certain that the running will be no problem.  Most weeks I break 26.2 miles without the extra motivation.  If I don&#8217;t hit 26.2 miles this month it will be because I&#8217;ve done something stupid and injured myself.  Swimming just requires me to go to the pool a couple of times and get a few hours of swimming in, not a big deal when you&#8217;re on a university campus.  The difficult thing will be biking.  I&#8217;m going to start biking to and from school every day, which gives me about 4 miles along the bike trails.  I&#8217;ll also have to do some longer bike routes on the weekend or on my off days from running.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks fun and is the first baby steps toward me eventually doing a real Ironman race.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I mentioned in my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/03/20/drobo-as-primary-storage-considered-harmful/">previous article about using a Drobo as primary MythTV storage</a>, the optimal solution for using a Drobo in MythTV is to record to an internal hard drive and then migrate the recordings later to the Drobo.  When migrating recordings care is required because the recording could be in use, either as a result of someone watching the recording or because transcode/commercial flagging jobs are running on the recording.  Fortunately, MythTV stores almost everything in a MySQL database, which makes it really easy to find out the status of a recording.</p>

<p>There are two tables that you&#8217;ll need to examine to ensure a recording is not currently in use.  The first table to check is the <strong>jobqueue</strong> table.  This table lists every recording that has pending jobs on it, whether user jobs or internal jobs such as commercial flagging.  It also leaves entries in the table for logs, so you can&#8217;t just make sure there are no entries for a program in the table.  The trick here is that you&#8217;ll want to make sure that the program you&#8217;re examining has a status that is greater than 255, which indicates that there isn&#8217;t a pending job.  All statuses over 255 indicate some sort of completion.</p>

<p>The second step is to make sure the program isn&#8217;t currently recording or being watched.  This is accomplished by looking at the <strong>inuseprogram</strong> table.  If a program has an entry in here, you certainly should not try to move the recording, and instead just wait until some later time to move it.</p>

<p>When you combine these two checks, you can be fairly certain that recording isn&#8217;t in use and moving it will be safe.  Rather than having to perform these checks by hand, I&#8217;ve created a script called MythMigrator which looks at a storage group and will migrate all recordings no in use to another group.  I&#8217;ve made a git repository available at <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/git/cgit.cgi/mythmigrate">http://patrick.wagstrom.net/git/cgit.cgi/mythmigrate</a> where you can download the script.</p>

<p>To utilize the script you&#8217;ll need to have two different storage groups defined, one where your recordings are initially stored, and another where they are archived for long term storage.  In my case these are called &#8220;Default&#8221; and &#8220;Long Term&#8221;.  Now it&#8217;s as simple as running a cron job at some lightly loaded time, for me this is about 9am, with the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>python MythMigrator.py <span class="s2">&quot;Default&quot;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Long Term&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it.  My recordings are safely migrated every morning and I hope this script can help you too.</p>

        <figcaption>Advertisement from mwave.com billing Drobo as your new Primary Storage </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>In October 2008 I purchased a 1st generation <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a> to provide additional storage space for my growing collection of recordings from <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  The plan was to use the Drobo as primary storage for MythTV recordings, something I believed to be acceptable because recording high-definition television maxes out at a couple of megabytes a second.  The Drobo is equipped with a USB2 connection and should be able to push well more than that.  The Drobo also provided some great advantages, such as on the fly addition of disks to the array, and data redundancy.  Along with the Drobo I purchased two Western Digital 1TB green drives.  After migrating some drives from my old array I had a Drobo with 2x1TB and 2x320GB drives.  I was able to take the number of drives in the actual case for my MythTV box down to just two, and in the process, reduce heat and noise from the machine.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now about five months into this little experiment, and it&#8217;s been met with mixed results.  After installing the Drobo I had about 700GB of a 1.6TB drive occupied.  Writes were fast and I never had problems with recording multiple shows, watching recordings, and even transcoding recordings all at the same time.  However, the Drobo allowed me to be lazy, I no longer needed to worry about diligently transcoding recordings.  Soon I found my 1.6TB drive filling up and yellow lights appeared telling me that I had better upgrade a disk in the array. Rather than inserting a new disk, I took the opportunity to transcode hundreds of recordings from MythTV.  When combined with cutting commercials and a small decrease in resolution, I can take a 4GB HDTV episode of the Office and drop it down to around 500MB with little degradation.</p>

<p>At this point I started to notice issues with MythTV under heavy usage.  On Monday nights I often have both HD tuners recording, an analog tuner recording, transcode jobs running, commercials being flagged, and I&#8217;m often watching a high def program.  This actually maxes out to a little under 10MB/s, something the Drobo should be able to do with little problem.  However, recordings from that evening would frequently end up missing small bits of video and jumping ahead.  For some shows this was no problem, but it could miss a critical moment in a show like 24.  I quickly identified the problem as the Drobo not being able to keep up with the requests.  During some down time I used <a href="http://www.coker.com.au/bonnie++/">Bonnie++</a> to calculate a synthetic estimate of disk throughput &#8211; the results were downright ugly for the Drobo:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve put the most relevant stats in red bold.  In the case of the Drobo, creating files at the block level, which should be the fastest results in a throughput of about 14MB/s, while the 320GB internal hard disk whizzes by at 55MB/s.  Likewise, the read rates are dramatically different, Drobo maxes out at 18MB/s, while the single internal hard drive reads at 71MB/s.  For comparison, my 4 drive software RAID 5 array used to read at 106MB/s.</p>

<p>Under most circumstances, switching to a disk array results in an increase in performance.  Both writes and reads are spread out across multiple disks, reducing issues with seek time and allowing parallel reads and writes.  However, that is clearly not the case with the Drobo.  Much of the bottleneck is probably a result of the USB2 interface to the Drobo, however, that cannot be the entire reason for the slow throughput.  Many other people have noted the slow performance of the Drobo (see <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/data_robotics_drobo">MaximumPC</a>, <a href="http://mac360.com/index.php/mac360/comments/drobo_the_best_mac_home_backup_system_ever/">Mac360</a>, and <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/external-hard-drives/drobo/4864-3190_7-32470303.html?messageID=2576911">CNet</a> reviews).  On occasion a reviewer will get slightly confused because the device automatically slows down as it gets closer to being full &#8211; this is ensure you have enough time to get another hard disk and replace a smaller one.  But what&#8217;s really strange is how sometimes the Drobo just stops writing for a period of seconds at a time.  Here&#8217;s some output from <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/">dstat</a> when copying a large file from an internal hard drive to the Drobo:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve highlighted the amount of data being written to the Drobo in red, where you can see that for extended periods of the file copy the Drobo decides it would rather not write anything.  What&#8217;s interesting is that this occurred right after the Drobo went into what seemed like a &#8220;Turbo Mode&#8221;, writing at rates of over 20MB/s.  Clearly, this is a problem, and such blocking of writes mean that Drobo cannot be used as a primary storage device for MythTV.  It works wonderful for playing back of recorded programs, storing music files, a drive for my photographs, but anything where streaming directly to disk is required is not a good idead for the Drobo.</p>

<p>However, I have an alternative solution.</p>

<p>MythTV has the concept of Storage Groups.  Originally they were designed to force MythTV to load balance recordings across multiple drives.  When a recording is selected it appears that MythTV scans all storage groups for the recording.  The solution I have adopted is to put the default recording group on an internal harddrive and create another storage group, called &#8220;Long Term&#8221;, which features the Drobo.  Periodically I then copy the files from the internal hard drive to the Drobo, thus ensuring that I always have enough space to record more.  Since I&#8217;ve done this I haven&#8217;t noticed any issues with disk load causing corruptions of recorded files.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Monday, March 9th I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis.  I haven&#8217;t finished all the little revisions yet, in fact I haven&#8217;t even opened the email from my advisors yet, but I&#8217;m largely finished with grad school.  If you&#8217;re interested in the thesis or the presentation, you can take a look at my <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/defense/">Patrick&#8217;s Awesome Thesis Defense Page</a> that is part of my <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/">academic home page</a>.</p>

<p>One nice aspect of grad school is that it afforded a reasonably flexible work schedule and the ability to travel a fair amount.  Some semesters, it was pretty crazy, other times it was pretty relaxed.  It all just depended on how productive I was being at work.  In that spirit, I decided to make a map of all the places that I slept while in grad school.  Each of the markers represents a physical building (or tent, etc), while the lines represent wonderful overnight flights.  I haven&#8217;t done anything to show how many times I&#8217;ve slept at a location or on a flight, but you get the general idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2009/02/dtvarmageddon.png"></p>

<p>The United States House of Representatives <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-352">voted 264-158 to extend the DTV Transition until June 12th</a>.  The vote went largely along party lines with a handful of each party switching sides, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to be called a bi-partisan approval.  However, it fails me why this should be a partisan issue in the first place.  In approving the delay, the House left in the provision that allows TV stations to switch over before June 12th if they choose.  This is an appealing option to many stations because of the high cost of running two sets of transmitters.  At a price of $0.12KWh, a 100,000W transmitter costs $12/hour to run, $288/day, and $8640/month.  A station with a 100,000W transmitter could therfore be expected to spend about $34,560 to keep their transmitter powered until June 12th.  Clearly they have incentive to commit to transition early.</p>

<p>The primary reason why many folks voted for this bill was because of a chart that Nancy Pelosi circulated that showed the number of consumers on the waiting list for DTV converter boxes in each congressional district (you can find the chat on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2009/02/dtv-delay-passes-264-158.ars">Ars Technica&#8217;s coverage of the bill</a>).  Every single congressional district has between 1200 and 9200 people on the waiting list for coupons &#8211; and a shocking 53,372 people in Puerto Rico.  Furthermore, every district saw their waiting list increase by at least 100 people, and some as many as 800 over the course of a weekend.  Ostensibly, approving a delay would ensure that these 181,013 new households and 1,781,218 previously registered households receive their coupons.</p>

<p>However, the program is out of money.  The only way that coupons are being sent out right now is if someone&#8217;s coupon expires.  If the list were capped at the number of people on it currently, and that seems unlikely, then the government still needs to come up with $156,983,520 to pay for those coupons.  Unfortunately, in approving the delay, no provision was made for this funding.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no evidence that delaying the transition will actually help people.  Two areas have already transitioned to DTV, Wilmington, NC which transitioned as a test in September, 2008, and the entire state of Hawaii, which transitioned last month to not interfere with a species of bird that is active in February.  If we look at Hawaii, however, there still are 2,974 people on the waiting list, with 129 new people just last weekend.  These are people who failed to submit their coupon request until after the transition happened.  My guess is that there&#8217;s a lot of grandmas out there who will be in the same boat &#8211; in addition to folks who have cable for most of their televisions, but may want to ditch it because of budget concerns (talk about a great lockin for cable companies).</p>

<p>So, now we&#8217;re left with an utter mess.  Instead of having a solid date for when analog broadcasting dies, stations can choose to switch anytime between Februrary 17 and June 12.  My hunch is that within a metro area, not all stations will switch at the same time, just confusing folks more &#8211; &#8220;I only get the station with the fifth grader show.  Where&#8217;s my CSI:Albany?&#8221;  Furthermore, it&#8217;s looking more and more unlikely that the government will come through with the estimated $300-$500 million necessary to fund the coupon program &#8211; they&#8217;ve got bigger things to worry about than whether or not people can continue to watch &#8220;How I met your Mother&#8221; and &#8220;Knight Rider&#8221;.  Finally, President Obama has yet to sign the bill, but has indicated support for the bill.  Therefore all the official advertising, even on <a href="http://www.dtv2009.gov/">dtv2009.gov</a> still lists February 17th as the date.</p>

<p>Yes the transition has come at a really bad time.  We&#8217;re fighting two wars.  Our economy is collapsing.  Now, the way they&#8217;ve handled transition indicates that it will be a mess for a long time to come.  In the end, the winners may be services like Dish network and Comcast, who are sending out millions of flyers around the country advertising budget rate plans starting at $9.99 for local channels.  The losers will almost certainly be the people who waited and haven&#8217;t requested their coupons, and will be left without whatever crappy summer programs the networks unleash on us in June.  But hey, it&#8217;s June, it should be nice outside.  I hear there&#8217;s lots of things to do outside.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Almost every modern CPU supports the ability to dynamically change its clock frequency &#8211; typically done to save power when there are lesser requirements placed on the system.  While the benefits for a laptop are obvious, more battery life and less heat, they may be a bit harder to understand for a desktop machine.  One application, however, where you should be particularly aware of CPU frequency scaling is with media center boxes.  The less often the CPU needs to speed up, the less heat, the quieter the fan, and the lower your power bill.  On my system, the differences can be pretty dramatic, with the CPU taking an extra 20-30 watts when running at full speed versus slower rates.</p>

<p>Within Linux, there are numerous ways that the CPU frequency is controlled, for example with <a href="http://deater.net/john/powernowd.html">powernowd</a> or the kernel level <a href="http://www.linuxinsight.com/ols2006_the_ondemand_governor.html">ondemand governor</a>, which is the default with most Linux distributions.  One of the aspects of these technologies is that when the system is heavily loaded with processes with high &#8220;nice&#8221; levels, the CPU will not speed up.  For most cases this is fine, but when running a MythTV box, it may be desirable to allow nice processes to increase the CPU speed &#8211; particularly as these nice processes may be things like transcoding or commercial cutting jobs.  Allowing the CPU to ramp up is particular helpful for evenings where many programs are recorded.  On a Monday night where my MythTV box grabs five HD programs, without allowing the CPU to speed up, it can take over a day to commercial flag and trascode everything.  When the CPU can speed up this time drops to about 8 hours.</p>

<p>Under Ubuntu the default configuration is to use the &#8220;ondemand&#8221; governor, which means there is no daemon running and the CPU will scale with demand and load.  However, there is nasty line buried in the /etc/init.d/powernowd startup script:</p>

<p>Line 108 is the culprit of our problems.  By echoing the string <code>1</code> to <code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load</code>, the ondemand governor will not take into account nice loads.  Under previous versions of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, or when you&#8217;re not using ondemand and actually need powernowd to run, this change was easily done <a href="/weblog/weblog/2006/01/13/faster-transcoding/">altering some settings in /etc/defaults</a> as I detailed 3 years ago.  However, now you need to hack the script yourself.  The simplest way is just to change the <code>1</code> to a <code>0</code> on line 102 of <code>/etc/init.d/powernowd</code>, giving the following line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo -n 0 > $x"cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Change this setting, then you can either reboot, or run <code>/etc/init.d/powernowd restart</code> as root.  If you watch your CPU speed (check out /proc/cpuinfo), you should notice that nice processes now speed up the CPU.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2009/02/dtvbyebye.png"></p>

<p>For the last 12 months American&#8217;s have been incessantly pounded with messages about the upcoming DTV transition.  In simple terminology, if you&#8217;ve got an old TV hooked up to rabbit ears, it&#8217;s going to break in the very near future.  The history of this problem is long, and complex, but it generally amounts to the fact that HDTV provides better quality in a smaller swath of frequency.  Frequency that is very valuable and can get the government a couple of billion dollars at auction.  Last year <a href="http://gizmodo.com/370350/fcc-700mhz-auction-winners-verizon-wins-c-block">Verizon managed to snag a good chunk of the 700MHz spectrum</a> currently used for television for it&#8217;s next generation 4G phone services.</p>

<p>In order to make this transition a little easier for Americans, the government approved the <a href="https://www.dtv2009.gov/">DTV coupon</a> program, which gives anyone who asks for it two $40 cards that can be used to the purchase of a digital to analog converter &#8211; in essence these boxes downsample HD content so folks with SD televisions can still use them.  When I was visiting relatives over the holiday season I saw that some of them had these and they generally worked pretty well.  Unfortunately, the program has been such a success that they&#8217;ve now run out of money and folks who waited are being put on a waiting list until more money is made available for the program.  In essence, these folks will loose their over the air TV signals on February 17th.</p>

<p>Congress, of course, wants to ensure that everyone can continue to watch their Wheel of Fortune and Nightline, and don&#8217;t want to be blamed by old people who vote, but turn off their hearing aids during advertisements and haven&#8217;t paid attention to the transition, for breaking their televisions.  Two weeks ago the Senate voted to approve a delay until June.  The house attempted to bring up under special rules, which would require a 2/3rds vote.  Republicans got together and found enough people to vote against bringing it up on special rules, largely because the process would forbid them from proposing amendments, to make the vote fail.  The DTV transition was still February 17th.</p>

<p>Now, much more recently the Senate has again passed a bill to extend the DTV transition period until June, and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/02/modified-dtv-delay-bill-set-for-house-revote-tuesday.ars">the House will vote on it tomorrow (Tuesday, February 3rd)</a>.  It&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s call about whether or not this bill will pass &#8211; there&#8217;s good chance it will as Democrats will most likely vote for it after shooting down Republican attempts to litter the bill with tax cuts.  President Obama will then sign the bill sometime later this week, less than two weeks before the transition, and magically, after we&#8217;ve been hearing for over a year that the transition would be February 17th, it will be moved to June.  Talk about confusion.</p>

<p>But wait, it gets even better than that.  Many stations have already put plans together and scheduled contractors to take down their analog transmitters.  If you&#8217;re a small station this is a no-brainer because for the last several years you&#8217;ve been broadcasting on two different transmitters &#8211; which can eat a large portion of your budget.  The new bill will do nothing to stop stations from shutting down their analog transmitters.  In others words, instead of having all channels going to static at once, we&#8217;ll be left with a situation where there is piecemeal and unpredictable deactivation of the analog spectrum taking place anytime between February 17th and the new deadline in June.  I&#8217;m sure Grandma is going to love that.</p>

<p>So now, we&#8217;re in the final countdown.  15 days to go, and it&#8217;s unclear if everything we&#8217;ve been hearing is correct or not.  However, the bigger problem is that there has been information about this transition for more than a year now &#8211; you even see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shutdownmessage.jpg">crawls running during television shows</a>.  Any television sold post 2007 must be able to accept ATSC digital television.  There still are people who don&#8217;t know about this?  Plausible.  After all, there are people who believe all sorts of crazy things, like that Saddam was behind 9/11.  So you can&#8217;t expect news to get to these people and inform them.  At what point will the government realize that some people will just have to be screwed by this transition?  My hunch is that there are few people left who have heard about the transition and haven&#8217;t done anything about it.  Especially considering that most Americans get their television through pay services such as cable or satellite and won&#8217;t be affected regardless.  I feel a little bad for the people who haven&#8217;t gotten their coupons yet, and I hope this is remedied soon, but fortunately February and March are pretty boring times in the US &#8211; few natural disasters, no elections, and only hockey and basketball are playing.  Maybe they should try sitting down with a book for bit instead?  Certainly that&#8217;s got more to it than the 5 phrases they see nightly on Wheel of Fortune.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since getting an iPhone I&#8217;ve put a bit more care into making sure that all of my music is ripped and available.  My music resides on a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a> plugged into my Linux box and shared via Samba to Windows and iTunes.  I&#8217;ve chosen to have iTunes organize my music folder automatically.  One down side of this is that iTunes then names files slightly differently and moves files around.  This resulted in hundreds of directories laying around with no content.  It also made it a pain when I wanted to find the actual file outside of iTunes &#8211; was &#8220;Everybody Hurts&#8221; in REM, R.E.M, or R.E.M_?  Because iTunes has organized my music only one of those directories has any content in it, I want to nuke the other ones.</p>

<p>I set about to create a script that will look through a directory tree and find all the directories that do not contain any music at lower levels and remove those directories.  Many of the directories have other crufty files in there, but I&#8217;m pretty certain there shouldn&#8217;t be anything other than music and covers in my music repository.  However, this means that I can&#8217;t just delete everything that isn&#8217;t a music file, because I want to keep covers in directories that still have music.</p>

<p>I accomplished this via a two stage script that first finds all subdirectories.  Then for each subdirectory find is executed again to get a count of the number of music files in the path.  If there are no music files in the directory, then the directory gets nuked.  Here&#8217;s the script:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#!/bin/bash
</span><span class='line'>    
</span><span class='line'>    IFS=$'\n'
</span><span class='line'>    for td in $(find . -type d); do
</span><span class='line'>        FC=$(find "$td" -type f -iname "*.mp3" -or -iname "*.aac" -or -iname "*.m4?"| wc -l)
</span><span class='line'>        if [ $FC == "0" ]; then
</span><span class='line'>            echo "*** $td $FC"
</span><span class='line'>            # uncomment these two lines if you'd like to be prompted to hit return to nuke stuff
</span><span class='line'>            # ls -lR $td
</span><span class='line'>            # read x
</span><span class='line'>            rm -rf "$td"
</span><span class='line'>        fi
</span><span class='line'>    done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&#8217;s a couple of commented lines in the middle there that you can uncomment and it will show a directory listing before waiting for you to hit return and nuke the directory.  As near as I can tell this worked perfectly for me, of course, it could easily eat your music files too.</p>

        <figcaption>I have just wiped away eight years of internets content! </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>One of the more interesting aspects of the inauguration today was how the website at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">whitehouse.gov</a> switched over from the Bush administration to the Obama site right around noon.  Shortly thereafter folks noticed <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/01/the-countrys-new-robotstxt-file">the drastic contrast in robots.txt files</a> between the two administrations.  Some folks are saying this represents a difference in attitudes between the administrations, which may be true, but it&#8217;s much more likely a result of a differences in information architecture and the smaller amount of content on Obama&#8217;s whitehouse.gov.</p>

<p>However, this highlights something a bit more interesting, when the website was switched over massive amounts of content were immediately rendered obsolete and for most purposes lost.  I&#8217;d imagine that National Archives has a copy of them, just like they archive email from the executive branch, but that doesn&#8217;t make it that easy to get access too.  While much of the information on the whitehouse.gov site is partisan banter, there are some elements that are lost &#8211; like the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080307031231/http://www.whitehouse.gov/kids">Whitehouse Kids page</a> (archive.org link), and Hurricane Katrina pages (not archived).</p>

<p>Given the increased importance of information placed on the web and the importance of a smooth transition of power, shouldn&#8217;t some work be done to archive this information?  I realize that it may not be possible to continue to provide interactive elements as the system administrators have left, but a static archive would be helpful and also serve as a valuable resource for folks looking back at previous presidencies.</p>

<time datetime="2008-12-13T13:52:45-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 13<span>th</span>, 2008</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m five and half years into my journey with MythTV, and in that time I&#8217;ve managed to upgrade my system several times.  Back in 2006 I wrote a tutorial on <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/tutorials/mythTV64/">installing MythTV under Ubuntu with a pcHDTV card and a firewire tuner</a>.  While some pieces of the machine remain the same, most of the pieces of hardware have changed pretty radically since then.</p>

<h3>The Case</h3>

<p>I use an <a href="http://www.antec.com/usa/productDetails.php?lan=us&amp;id=15730">Antec Overture 2</a> desktop ATX case.  It&#8217;s a fairly large case, but it fits nicely in my entertainment center.  Unfortunately, it vents out the sides and is a tight fit, so I had to do some modifications to give it better airflow.   I removed the back of my entertainment center where the box is (a virtual necessity given the number of cables hanging from it), and also cut a hole in the side leading from one compartment to another so the vent from the power supply would go somewhere.</p>

<h3>The Processor</h3>

<p>Athlon 64x2 4400+ on an MSI K8N-Neo4 Platinum motherboard - the processor is overclock slightly, so it runs at about the speed of a 5000+.  You can&#8217;t get either of these anymore because it&#8217;s a socket 939 setup.  It goes to show you don&#8217;t need a beast of a Core i7 processor to run MythTV.  It has 2GB of Dual Channel DDR ram.  Certainly not anything overly spectacular, but pleanty for running a combination Front End/Backend MythTV setup.  While viewing 1080i HD the processor maxes out at about 60% utilization of a single core.</p>

<h3>Capture Devices</h3>

<p>Analog cable is captured using a WinTV PVR-250 PCI card.  The card is getting pretty old, being the first part of MythTV I bought, but it still works like a champ.  I capture HD Cable using an <a href="http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun">HD HomeRun</a>.  I only have the most basic of cable, just enough for broadcast and a few other channels, so the HD HomeRun can capture everything.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2008/12/hdhomerun.jpg">
        <figcaption>Silicon Dust HD HomeRun Networked HDTV Tuner </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>I can&#8217;t stress how great the HD HomeRun is for capturing OTA or QAM unencrypted cable.  It&#8217;s a small box, about the size of a few DVDs stacked, with two coax inputs, and an ethernet output.  These boxes have virtually zero configuration, and because it just speaks a simple network protocol, you don&#8217;t need to worry about kernel changes or drivers.  The HD HomeRun just works.  Additionally, because it takes up no slots in the computer, you can go with a much smaller form factor system.  This works nicely for my eventual goal of putting everything on a Mac Mini or comparable tiny system.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Inside of the Overture 2 I have two 320GB hard drives running as a mirrored pair.  This is where my database, photos, and music live.  For recordings I have a 1st generation <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a> with 2x1GB and 2x320GB drives in it, providing about 1.6TB of protected space.  The Drobo is another great device that if you&#8217;re serious about MythTV you should strongly consider getting.  Some folks will complain about the noise, but I&#8217;ve never noticed the Drobo make any notice.  Although, as a disclaimre, I have two fairly large fish tanks in my living room that produce significant noise.  HD actually doesn&#8217;t need that much bandwidth and the Drobo can easily supply enough over USB for all of my needs.  As the limiting factor in the system is the USB bandwidth, you&#8217;re safe going for slightly slower, quieter, and cooler drives like the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=336">Western Digital GreenPower</a> drives.</p>

<h3>Display</h3>

<p>Inside the Overture 2 is an nVidia GeForce 6600LE.  It&#8217;s fanless and really underpowered, I won&#8217;t want to play games on it or anything like that, but at the time, it was a decent card to have, unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t support VDPAU, so at some point it will probably have to go.  This is connected via a DVI->HDMI cable to a Sharp Aquos 32&#8221; 720p display.  I realize the videophiles are laughing at me because it&#8217;s a small TV, but the picture is quite good, blacks are black, no overscan, etc.  The display is driven at near-native resolution of 1366x768.  This means I lose a 1 pixel strip on each side.  I&#8217;ve never actually noticed that.</p>

<h3>Remote Control</h3>

<p>Currently I use the remote control that came with the WinTV PVR-250 and the attached IR dongle.  It&#8217;s been supported just as long as the WinTV card has and it works well enough.  There are some strange quirks where sometimes it seems to fall asleep and needs to be &#8220;woken up&#8221;.  In addition, it only accepts IR codes from Hauppauge remotes.  The HD Homerun also has an IR receiver that is more generic and should work with most remotes.  I haven&#8217;t gotten a chance to play with that yet, however.</p>

<h3>Future Upgrades</h3>

<p>For my current cable signal, it seems as though this works quite nicely.  If I were to add components to my MythTV box in the future it would most likely be a <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html">Hauppauge HD-PVR</a> once I get a better selection of cable channels.  At that point, there is a good chance I&#8217;ll reture the PVR-250 card and switch to a much smaller case with everything external.</p>
