Banning Link Spammers

<!-- Date: 2004-12-07 13:22 -->

Yesterday I talked about how to <a href="/weblog/meta/rssCaching.xml">cache RSS feeds in
PyBlosxom</a> using only <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>, a cron job, and a package of <a href="http://www.twinkies.com/">hostess twinkies</a>.  Today,
I'm going a little further.  I've been having problems with link spammers hitting my pages
and using up my bandwidth.  I'm pretty sure they're all coming from the same source, but
they're not the same block of IP addresses, maybe they're zombied.  Anyway, the urls
are all terribly predictable like <my:verbatim>http://www.car-insurancedeals-4u.info/</my:verbatim>
or something like that.  Anyway, they're all .info domains with multiple dashes in the
domain name.  Being as there are basically no legitimate .info or .biz sites, I can guarantee
that someone is up to no good.  On the offhand that you are .info site that would like to
link to me, I can allow the link by changing my config.  Just email me.
</p>

Anyway, I whipped up a bit more mod_rewrite fun to look at the referer and if they're from
one of these "sites", then it sends them a forbidden error.  Should help save some bandwidth
and also stop these idiots from appearing all the time in my logs.

<pre>        # Ban link spammers
        # this stops any domain of the form: xxx-xxx.info (or derivitave of that)
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://.*(-.*)+\.info/ [NC]
        RewriteRule ^.*$ - [F]</pre>
<p>
I realize that this has the potential to turn into an arms race.  Oh well.  Maybe some
day I'll get around to building a better firewall for my network and have this all done
through <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">pf</a> or <a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/">layer 7 filtering</a> or something like that.
