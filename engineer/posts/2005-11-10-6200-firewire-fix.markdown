I wrote a [patch](http://cvs.mythtv.org/trac/changeset/7836) for [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/)
that fixes some of the issues with a DCT 6200 being on a system where node 1 is not established.  This is useful
for folks like me have multiple firewire ports on their PCs.   I feel ownership in MythTV now.  Woot.
