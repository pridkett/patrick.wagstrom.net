My MythTV Box Blew Up

While not entirely true, that's the gist of what happened.  Last Sunday, October 30th, the machine
was hanging a lot.  After lots of cussing, I decided just to shut the machine off and banish it to
the corner for a while.  When I got back the machine wouldn't post and was making a funky smell.
I'm still not sure if it's the motherboard, processor, or power supply.  I hope it's just the power
supply.

In any case, it provided a nice excuse to upgrade my computer with new toys.  All of the cards and
drives inside the computer were fine.  Unfortunately, I couldn't reuse much of the other components such as memory, or rather chose not to
reuse much of it.  Here's what I got for the new computer:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (Venice core)</li>
	<li>MSI K8N-Neo4 Platinum Motherboard</li>
	<li>XFX GeForce 6600 (256MB ram)</li>
	<li>1GB Ram</li>
	<li>Antec Overture II Media Center Case</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since then I've been fighting to get everything working again.  But it looks like it's all basically
going.  We were able to watch the high-definition version of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/">Monsters Inc.</a> with little problem.  The DVD player
and remote work fine.  I even have it controlling the cable box so we can record digital cable or
high definition right from the cable box.  Tonight I'm going to get <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV card</a> working on it, provided that
I can actually get XvMC to work properly.  I'm working on a thorough writeup on how to get MythTV
working in this sorta setup, and I'll post it soon.

In the mean time, here are some pictures of the system as I built it and put it in the entertainment
center.  For reference on what the old setup looked like, you may want to see these pictures: <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/resources/images/blog/mythTVBox.jpg">old mythtv box</a>, <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/resources/images/blog/mythTVSetup.jpg">old entertainment center</a>.

<p><b>Update 11/08/2005:</b> I started writing this yesterday, but didn't donwload the
photos until this morning.  In the mean time I've managed to get XvMC working
by beating it into submission using a brute force method.  This means that HDTV
is more or less working, but I can tell that my disk I/O is hurting.  It may
be time to invest in that large RAID 5 array soon.
