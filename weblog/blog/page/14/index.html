  <div class="entry-content"><p>So how much does it cost to buy off your fair use rights?  According to my analysis, somewhere around $305,740.  That is
the amount that the National Association of Broadcasters and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association have
spent in the last two years to <a href="http://beta.news.com.com/Politicians+want+to+raise+broadcast+flag/2100-1028_3-5886722.html">buy the twenty reps who support the Broadcast Flag</a>.  This was prompted by my previous look at <a href="/weblog/weblog/2005/10/doyle-for-sale">who is buying off Mike Doyle</a>.
I swear, stuff like this has me almost angry enough to run for congress.</p>

<p>All this great stuff was mined out of <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Open Secrets</a>.  How I wish they
exposed some sort of XML-RPC or SOAP based interface to query information.  This stuff was not hidden in the
most obvious of places.  I left out many other probable
supporters/bribers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag">broadcast flag</a> such as <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.asp?strID=C00248716&amp;Cycle=2006">Comcast</a>, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00197863&amp;cycle=2006">Cablevision</a>,
and of course <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.asp?strID=C00279216&amp;cycle=2006">Clear Channel</a>.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that I have yet to hear anything from Mike Doyle&#8217;s office about this situation.
Please, take time to call them and let them that bad boys do not get re-elected.  His washington number is
202-225-2135.  It&#8217;s important that we show him that the people of Pittsburgh are more important than Beltway
interests, which is where <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/geog.asp?CID=N00001373&amp;cycle=2006">he gets most of his money</a>.  This guy does not represent Pittsburgh.  Let&#8217;s boot him out.  I also called the
democratic party here in Pittsburgh to ask about this issue, no response there yet either.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I blogged about Mike Doyle&#8217;s support of the broadcast flag.  I was fortunate enough to have an officemate overhear
my call to Doyle&#8217;s Washington office (202-225-2135) and ask me what the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag">broadcast flag</a> was.  I got my
little chance to get on my soapbox and explain.  My officemate quickly realized this would
be bad for innovation, and saw the problems with it.  He then asked me who was really
paying for all of this.  Off to <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/">Open Secrets</a>
to find out.
Hmm, that&#8217;s interesting, the #2 supporter of Mike Doyle, the national association of broadcasters.
Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.asp?CID=N00001373&amp;cycle=2006">top 10 supporters of Mike Doyle</a>:</p>

<p>A little more digging shows that almost 2/3rd of Doyle&#8217;s money comes from the Washington DC area, and only about
12% actually comes from Pittsburgh, the area he is supposed to be representing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>More digging reveals that <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/races/contrib.asp?ID=PA14&amp;cycle=2004&amp;special=N">Doyle&#8217;s top contributor for the 2004 election was Comcast</a>.  Yeah, this guy represents the people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title sums it up quite nicely.  Instead of making it easy for me to watch HDTV, they&#8217;re making it quite difficult.  I called them last week to inquire about HDTV support on cable.  I was told that I needed to get a cable box, that would run me $5.99 a month.  For another few bucks I could get the digital classic package.  Not too bad I guess.  Anyway, today the guy arrived.  Was a little shocked to see that I didn&#8217;t have a box but he had one in his truck, a Motorola DCT 6200 to be exact.  This is the nicer one with firewire outputs.</p>

<p>Anyway, we hooked it up pretty quickly and I was getting the stations.  The problem is that I didn&#8217;t have any menu support, so I had no guide information. Furthermore, I couldn&#8217;t actually get HDTV to display on my DVI output.  That blew.  Instead, I got a nice message saying that it couldn&#8217;t authenticate me.  What the fuck?  I can barely understand this message, I could hardly imagine what would happen to grandma reading it.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2005/09/hdcpMonitor1.jpg">
        <figcaption>It says &#8220;please&#8221;, but I dont want to </figcaption>
    </figure>




  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2005/09/hdcpMonitor2.jpg">
        <figcaption>Apparently the setup screen is so secret I can&#8217;t see that either. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>What was happening is that box was trying to authenticate using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDCP">HDCP</a> to my monitor which doesn&#8217;t support it.  It&#8217;s not like I can copy the digital signal from the monitor, but I digress.  Basically, when the DVI is plugged in or powered on it waits a few seconds to get a handshake back from the monitor saying that it won&#8217;t let you copy stuff.  If it doesn&#8217;t get it, it blacks out.  So much for fair use.  To make things worse, it appeared that I could only get the display when using the DVI, so I had to any settings or browsing for video on demand in the few seconds before the cable box decided I couldn&#8217;t see that anymore.  What the hell?</p>

<p>After some digging around, I found the <a href="http://broadband.motorola.com/dvr/downloads/DCT6200-08_UserGuide.pdf">DCT 6200 User Guide</a> on Motorola&#8217;s site.  It still didn&#8217;t provide any information about how to get to the uber setup screen that the tech who installed the box got to, but it did tell me that if it was set up to output HDTV then it would not be able to overlay the graphics on the SVideo or composite outputs.  Wow, what crappy American engineering. There is hope, you can get to the setup by turning the box off, then hitting the menu key when the box is off.  This will let you do some menu stuff using the LED displays on the front of the cable box.  Basically, set all outputs to 480i and you&#8217;ll be able to get your display back.</p>

<p>So now I decided to play with HDTV.  It turns out that I can use the box to tune HDTV, but it will downgrade the coax output to SD.  Bullshit.   So, I tried hooking up my cable line directly to my <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV</a> card.  Running some fun scanning software shows me that indeed I&#8217;m getting lots of signals.  221 of them to be exact.  That can&#8217;t be right I thought.  Running the file command on a single dump didn&#8217;t prove helpful, it just said data.  Mplayer was choking on the first few.  Still, it seemed odd.  So, I decided to write a little script to scan all 221 channels.  Voila, I&#8217;ve got some HDTV channels coming in.  Fear Judge Hatchett in HD.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m left wondering if I need the box at all.  I can probably just cancel it because it doesn&#8217;t work as advertised.  But then I would loose Sci-Fi, basically the only good new channel I get.  We&#8217;ll have to see.  I may also decide to pick up another tuner card and a firewire cable to control the box and just record programs from that.  Could be a lot of fun.  More updates later.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> One of my helpful readers pointed me to the <a href="http://www.spatz-tech.de/spatz/dvi_magic.htm">DVI Magic</a> device, which is sold as an HDCP compatible DVI amplifier.  Looks very interesting, but a but too expensive for me at 399 euro&#8217;s.  Pity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I was pleasantly surprised to find that my new hard disk from <a href="http://www.outpost.com/">Outpost.com/Fry&#8217;s</a> had already arrived, despite ordering it on Friday and only paying for ground shipping.  Note to the other folks from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=pittsburgh,+pa&amp;spn=0.086881,0.135844&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en">the Burgh</a>, Outpost ships from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=columbus,+oh&amp;spn=0.087497,0.135844&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en">Columbus</a>, thus you get your stuff fast.  Having received this nice shiny new 200GB hard disk, I needed a way to integrate into my system.  I consider this disk to be a stop-gap solution until I can afford a <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/singleLevel5-c.html">RAID-5</a> setup.</p>

<p>Anyway, before I began this little adventure, I was running low on storage space.  I keep my <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> recordings in <code>/mnt/store</code> and the 200G drive I picked up in February was now loaded down with lots of <a href="http://www.snpp.com/">Simpsons</a>, <a href="http://www.familyguyfiles.com/">Family Guy</a>, and various movies.  The overall disk picture looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>patrick@dreams:~# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda6              33G   24G  6.9G  78% /
tmpfs                 380M     0  380M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/hda1              90M   24M   62M  28% /boot
/dev/hdc1             190G  185G  1.9G  98% /mnt/store
/dev/hda5             9.3G  8.7G  601M  94% /home
/dev                   33G   24G  6.9G  78% /.dev
none                  5.0M  2.8M  2.3M  56% /dev
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, I have an NEC DVD dual layer burner on <code>/dev/hdb</code>.  My task at hand was to merge the new 200GB disk with the existing 200GB disk.  I had a variety of possible tools for this, including just a bunch of symlinks to the old files, <a href="http://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/project-unionfs.html">unionfs</a>, and <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/lvm2/">LVM</a>.  Symlinks might work okay, but there is a lot of manual work that needs to be done.  On the bright side, if I lose a disk with that method, I only lose the recordings on that disk.  UnionFS allows me to ignore the symlink problem and stack the two drives.   However, one drive would be read only, so it would never get any more full.  This really wasn&#8217;t desirable either.  Really, I need some sort of RAID setup.  Not so much for the redundancy, but for the consistent disk image across drives.</p>

<p>So normally what I&#8217;d be looking for is called <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/singleLevel0-c.html">RAID-0</a> or <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/hdd/perf/raid/levels/jbod-c.html">JBOD</a> (Just a bunch of disks).  The difference between the two is that RAID-0 stripes the data between the disks, meaning that different chunks of the data are on different disks.  This gives increased I/O throughput provided that the disks are on different controllers.  JBOD just concatenates the disks together as one big disk and when the first disk fills up, work begins on the second disk.  The problem is that both of these would require me to blow away both drives to get going.  I&#8217;m not about to try and find all those Simpsons expisodes again.  Furthermore, if I ever wanted to add more disks to this setup, I&#8217;d still have to go this pain again.  This was not desirable.</p>

<p>Enter the joy of LVM for Linux.  LVM stands for Logical Volume Management, and it&#8217;s a method that you can be completely agnostic about the underlying disk setup for a mount point.  The current version is LVM 2 and most distros ship with LVM2 support enabled (Ubuntu works just fine with LVM).  The basic concept with LVM is that at the top level you have the concept of a volume group. This is a group of disks that you can create many mount points out of.  For most users, you&#8217;ll be fine with just one volume group, but if you&#8217;re going to be doing a lot of moving of disks, you might want to have different volume groups to make things easier. Within a volume group you have a collection of physical volumes, which are essentially just block devices.  Under Linux this means that you can either dedicate an entire disk or just a partition of a disk.  In my case, I was dedicating two entire disks to LVM. This means that I get an extra 1K of space by not needing the partition table at the front of the disk.  Woohoo.  So, my first step was to initialize the new hard disk, now called <code>/dev/hdb</code> as an LVM physical volume.</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# pvcreate /dev/hdb
</code></pre>

<p>With an initial physical volume created, it&#8217;s possible to move on and create a volume group.  Like I stated earlier, for most home users, having a single volume group will be just fine.  Especially if you&#8217;re just using it for MythTV. To get things started, I created a volume group called mythtv_store to indicate that I was using it for MythTV and told LVM that I would be using <code>/dev/hdb</code> as the first physical volume in the group.  You&#8217;ll also need to tell LVM that the volume group is accessible.  This is what the second command does.</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# vgcreate mythtv_store /dev/hdb
rootodreams:~# vgchange -a y mythtv_store
</code></pre>

<p>The final thing that you&#8217;ll need if you want to access your disk is to create a logical volume on top of the volume group.  It&#8217;s possible to use LVM to set up all sorts of fun stuff like striping between disks, but we&#8217;re not going to be doing that because we&#8217;re starting with just one disk.  We want the setup to take up the entirety of the disk currently allocated to the volume group.  To do that we first figure out how many physical extents we have in the volume group.  A physical extent is a chunk of a physical disk that can be allocated to a logical volume.  When we run the <code>vgdisplay</code> command (more about that later), we&#8217;ll how man physical extents the drive has by looking at the line that says Total PE.  For convenience and confusion sake, we&#8217;ll call our new logical volume mythtv.</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# vgdisplay mythtv_store | grep "Total PE"
  Total PE              47695
root@dreams:~# lvcreate -l 47695 mythtv_store -n mythtv
</code></pre>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what&#8217;s going on you can run pvdisplay to show the physical volumes, vgdisplay to show the volume groups you&#8217;ve just created, and <code>lvdisplay</code> to show the logical volumes.  Here&#8217;s the output from my system (somewhat faked as I&#8217;m writing this after creating the LVM setup):</p>

<p>The first line of the lvdisplay output is what we&#8217;re looking for.  This is the device name that you&#8217;ll use to access the logical volume, in my case it is <code>/dev/mythtv_store/mythtv</code>.  In general it goes by the name of <code>/dev/[VOLUME GROUP NAME]/[LOGICAL VOLUME NAME]</code>.  From here we can see that we&#8217;ve got a 186.27 GB logical disk that we&#8217;ve just created.  The next step is to format the thing and port our data over.  I&#8217;ve been using JFS because it has speedy deletes for the large files that MythTV produces, however, you may want to consider using EXT3 or ReiserFS.  The main reason is because you cannot shrink a JFS drive (or XFS for that matter).  If you want a filesystem you can shrink, you must use EXT3 or ResierFS (at least at this time).  Anyway, here&#8217;s how I formatted the drive, mounted it, and copied all my data from the old drive over (the old drive was mounted at <code>/mnt/store</code>).</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# mkfs.jfs /dev/mythtv_store/mythtv
root@dreams:~# mkdir /mnt/tmp
root@dreams:~# mount /dev/mythtv_store/mythtv /mnt/tmp
root@dreams:~# cp -a /mnt/store /mnt/tmp
</code></pre>

<p>A quick look shows that all my files copied successfully.  If you haven&#8217;t already, now would be a good time to shut down MythBackend, but lets hope you did that a long time ago.  Now comes the part that you&#8217;ll feel queasy about, but it should work.  We&#8217;re going to blow away the old disk, add it to the volume group, and then extend that logical volume and our JFS file system.  The first thing that we need to do is blow away the partition table on /dev/hdc.  This is necessary because LVM doesn&#8217;t like seeing a partition table there if it&#8217;s going to use the whole disk.  Thanks to dd this is pretty straight forward.</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdc bs=1k count=1
root@dreams:~# pvcreate /dev/hdc
root@dreams:~# vgextend mythtv_store /dev/hdc
</code></pre>

<p>These steps have added <code>/dev/hdc</code> to the volume group, but it hasn&#8217;t yet been added to the logical volume.  To do that we&#8217;re going to need to know the total size of volume group.  Once again, grep becomes our friend, and we use the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# vgdisplay mythtv_store | grep "Total PE"
  Total PE              96315
root@dreams:~# lvextend -l 96315 /dev/mythtv_store/mythtv
</code></pre>

<p>Now if we run lvdisplay we&#8217;ll see that the disk has been extened.  However, looking at the output of df it&#8217;s clear that the disk space has not been increased.  This is because we haven&#8217;t told JFS to extend the disk yet.</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# lvdisplay

none                  5.0M  2.8M  2.3M  56% /dev
</code></pre>

<p>The final step is to tell JFS to resize the mounted filesystem.  In order to do this, JFS needs to execute a remount/resize command.  This means that you need to have the filesystem mounted, then execute the following command:</p>

<pre><code>root@dreams:~# mount -o remount,resize /mnt/store
</code></pre>

<p>If all goes well, it will take a few seconds to mount the disk, and then you&#8217;ll have a nice big disk to store all of your MythTV recordings on.  Here&#8217;s the final output from the important commands on my system:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been having some fun with <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> as of late.
 I found out that <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> now
offers HDTV in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.426597,-79.940171&amp;spn=0.022439,0.045417&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en">my neighborhood</a>, so I placed the call.  It was going to cost me
an extra $5.99 a month for HDTV, as I&#8217;d need a receiver box.  Bullocks.  Luckily,
<a href="http://brainflush.blogspot.com/">Evan</a> told me a nifty trick I
could try.  We have just the basic level of cable, costs us $14 or so a month.
Mainly we have it because it ends up saving us $1 off the cable modem bill
($56 for cable modem and basic cable, $57 for cable modem alone).  He said that
he added digital classic to his basic cable for $10 a month, and then got
standard cable with it.  Probably this is due to the use of filters on the
line and the need to remove the filters for digital.  Hmm.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, the lady on the other end of the line offered me the
digital class for another $4 a month, bringing the total to $9.99 more a month.
I asked this several times to make sure we weren&#8217;t getting signed up for
something huge, and she confirmed it.  We&#8217;ll see if the Evan trick works.  I
also specifically requested a DCT-6200 cable box, with firewire for my
installation, this should still allow me to use an antenna to get CBS, which
I understand is not carried on HDTV on Comcast.  No Steelers in HD sucks.</p>

<p>To complement this, and our upcoming deluge of programs, I realized that the
current 200GB would just not cut it.  Luckily, the folks at
<a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/">FatWallet</a> found a scorching deal on
a 200GB hard drive from <a href="http://www.outpost.com/">Outpost</a> for only
$50 after $50 rebate.  Score.  So, we should soon have 400GB of storage on
the MythTV box and HDTV, well we&#8217;ll have HDTV but not on Myth because I still
can&#8217;t pick up a new computer yet (for that reason, see my
<a href="/weblog/old/bible/">progress on reading the Bible</a>).  Anyway, here&#8217;s to
what will hopefully be a nice upgrade.</p>

<p>I also go ambitious and installed Mythweb finally, no you can&#8217;t see it.  But
to make people happy, I did create a virtual host where you can see what&#8217;s
coming up on my MythTV box.  Be sure to check out <a href="http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/">http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/</a>
for all your useless info about my box.  If I could figure out how to make Mythweb
read only, I might make that point to my mythweb install, but not for right now.
Thank you <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_proxy.html">Apache mod_proxy</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like many people, I&#8217;m morbidly watching the upcoming disaster in south east Texas. I decided that now would be the time to play with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> to see what it can do.  I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed.  Here&#8217;s a snapshot of what I just did:</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also posted a <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/hurricaneRita.kmz">Hurricane Rita KMZ</a> file for use with Google Earth.  The images are links to the always updating ones on the National Weather Service&#8217;s page, so if they move the map much, you&#8217;ll get it all messed up.  It also has links to the the wind maps for both tropical storm and hurricane force winds.  Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week <a href="/weblog/weblog/computer/gizmo.xml">discovered Gizmo</a>, the neato VOIP
service from <a href="http://www.sipphone.com/">SIPPhone.com</a>.  After talking to
some <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUGgers</a>, I was inspired to install
<a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a>, the open source PBX software.
If I actually had a land line, this might be more useful, but without one, I was
determined to make use of it.  As I found out, it&#8217;s pretty simple to do a gateway both
to and from the PSTN.</p>

<p>The first thing that I discovered is that it is possible to have Asterisk behave
as your Gizmo client.  Using <a href="http://www.voip-info.org/tiki-index.php?page=Asterisk%20settings%20Gizmo">these instructions</a>, you&#8217;ll quickly get it so folks dialing your Gizmo number will
reach your Asterisk PBX.  Supposedly, those instructions will also let you use
another client to make calls out to the GIZMO network, but I&#8217;ve been unable to
get that to work yet.</p>

<p>The next cool thing was getting a free Washington state phone number from <a href="http://www.ipkall.com/">IPKall</a>.
It was terribly simple to set up, just fill out the form, and for the SIP proxy give it proxy01.sipphone.com,
and my Gizmo phone number as the user, and within an hour I had a dial in number to my computer.
So now I can go and dial 360-469-0573 and I&#8217;ll reach my computer.  Right now it&#8217;s just an echo
test, but I&#8217;d eventually like to be able to dial into my MythTV box.</p>

<p>Anyway, as I do more fun stuff, I&#8217;ll post it here.  Next up is fun
with <a href="http://www.fwd.pulver.com/">Free World Dialup</a>.  That will provide 1-800 number access direct from my box.  I was hoping
that I could already have it working, but it&#8217;s having problems with IAX (that&#8217;s the Inter-Asterisk
protocol) at the moment.  Also, it looks like <a href="http://www.iaxtel.com/">IAX Tel</a> is
also not behaving well right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When all the cool kids were raving about
<a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, I went and signed up for an
account.  I haven&#8217;t used it much.  I think I got maybe two calls on it, and
both times I didn&#8217;t have a microphone handy to actually take the call.
Something about Skype always made me a little uneasy.  Maybe it was the
fact that they didn&#8217;t reveal just how it worked.  What encryption was in
use?  Could they drop in on your calls?  Well, now that <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> bought Skype, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll use them much anymore.
eBay is known for not being a very privacy friendly company, and let&#8217;s face
it, their customer support sucks.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a guy like me to do?  Well, luckily Michael Robertson (the same
guy behind MP3.com and <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a>), has
started a cool toy called <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</a>,
which is based on standard SIP technology. That&#8217;s nice.  They also have clients
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (linspire based debs, but whatever, it
works fine on <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a>).</p>

<p>What makes this really nice is that first, you get a free quarter to make
phone calls.  At 1.8 cents a minute to the US this won&#8217;t go really far, but
it should be enough for me to make a phone call or two.  Second, because it&#8217;s
SIP based, you can dial into your client from any regular phone.  There&#8217;s a
<a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/access-numbers.html">list of access numbers</a> for a large number of cities.  Just pick an access number, press 1, and then
type the SIP Phone number you&#8217;d like to dial (my SIP number is 1-747-617-4120).  With free long distance dialing
on cell phones, this means that it&#8217;s no problem to call my computer from
your cell phone.  That&#8217;s cool.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ve also got a slew of other nifty features, mainly made possible by using
a real standard.  For example, if I get a voice mail, it gets emailed to my
GMail account as a wav file.  Then I can download the file and listen to the
message at my leisure.  I would also think that in theory that it should be
compatable with <a href="http://www.zen13655.zen.co.uk/mythphone.html">MythPhone</a>, so you can easily integrate a phone into your MythTV box.  I&#8217;m just
in a state of wow right now.  Maybe one of these days I&#8217;ll need to find a way
to hook up <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hot damn, it looks like I might actually finish the creation of Priblog that
I&#8217;ve always been talking about.  While I really like the idea of working
with flat XML files, the fact of the matter is that performance matters to
me.  I hate how slow pyBlosxom becomes when it has to walk all of my entries.
The additional overhead of firing off a python process on every page hit
isn&#8217;t that great either.  I&#8217;m sure I could find a way to get around that
using <a href="http://www.modpython.org/">mod_python</a> or something like
that, but I think that will just raise more problems.</p>

<p>Instead, I&#8217;ve been playing with (cue <a href="http://www.warrantweb.net/">Warrant</a> music here) <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>.  Basically,
CherryPy is a persistant python process that serves up web pages.  This means
that I can maintain one set of database connections, one listing of the entries,
and all that jazz.  It&#8217;s terribly easy to create nice web applications with it.
Add in built-in session management, and you can see why I&#8217;m happy.</p>

<p>Basically the new version of Priblog works with a
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> backend.  It requires
<a href="http://www.libxml.org/">LibXML</a> to generate the XML pages and
do some fun stuff with XSLT for browsers that can&#8217;t handle it, like IE.
Right now, I&#8217;d estimate that I&#8217;m at about 50% of the progress that I have
in my pyBlosxom install.  I still need to add in category browsing and date
browsing, but those are the last outstanding features.  It looks like this
time I might actually finish something.  Yay.</p>

<p>I half feel like I&#8217;m now in a race with another guy.  Apparently there
are <a href="http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-09-11/PyBlosxom_">others who wish to accomplish the same</a>.  I guess mine won&#8217;t truly be a pyBlosxom,
because for time being you&#8217;re going to need a database behind it.  Not sure
if I&#8217;ll keep that idea forever or not.</p>
