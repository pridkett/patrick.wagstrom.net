Here is the old logo for [CASOS](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/).  It
looks okay, but it's only in raster format and furthermore has lots of annoying
artifacts from being JPEG compressed a few too many times.

I got tired of this, so I created a nice new vector image.  This was done using
[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/) and [Autotrace](http://autotrace.sf.net/) (for the words).  Now that it's SVG, not only is it smaller
once compressed, but it also is infinitely scalable and convertable.  If you
can see the picture, [click here](/media/2005/02/casosLogo.svg) to download the SVG file.  You might need the SVG Plugin from Adobe.

I was really impressed with how easy this was.  There still are a few tweaks
that should be done to the letters, which will reduce the file size even more,
but in general it's pretty nice for my first effort at creating a vector
graphic.  Inkscape and Autotrace made it terribly easy too.
