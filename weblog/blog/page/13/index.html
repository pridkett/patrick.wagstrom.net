  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been writing a nice <a href="/weblog/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml">tutorial on setting up MythTV on Ubuntu x86_64</a> over the course of the past few weeks.  Please feel free to browse
it and give feedback.  It still is a work in progress and I could certainly use some help in
some spots.  I should clarify this by explaining that I&#8217;ve got my system more or less working,
with the exception of static on my pcHDTV which I understand is an electro-magnetic interference issue that
I can&#8217;t do anything about.  When I move that card into another computer, I&#8217;ll add details about
that too.</p>

<p>For those that are concerned, I&#8217;ll eventually put up a TRAC site for managing the project and
and providing access to the repository of revisions.  My goal is to provide a slightly more up-to-date
and <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> centric version of <a href="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/">Jarod Wilson&#8217;s Fedora MythTV Guide</a>.  I know, that&#8217;s a lot of hoping.  Come on magic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice">google juice</a>, lead people to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So in my quest to actually get MythTV working well I&#8217;ve been doing a decent amount of system profiling to check where the bottle neck in my system is.  One tool that I&#8217;fe found really helpful is <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/">dstat</a>.  This is basically a replacement/clone of vmstat, iostat, netstat and other helpful tools. Really nifty if you want to to help debug issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It kills me how I&#8217;m so close I can feel it, but it&#8217;s completely out of my power to reach a 100% working system right now.  The reason?  I&#8217;m experiencing digital noise on my HDTV tuner card.  This REALLY blows. When the system is at low load, I have no problem recording HDTV programs, however, as the load increases, I see lots of noise show up on my system. Apparently, I&#8217;m not the only one having these problems, as <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/users/159591">this thread from the MythTV users list</a> shows.  I&#8217;ve also started a <a href="http://pchdtv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1077">discussion on the pcHDTV.com forums</a>.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a guy to do then?  I bought a system to make it HDTV compatible, but the HDTV is sucking it up.  I can get HDTV over the firewire, so I may just have to loose digital cable for right now.  Maybe this is the kick in the ass that I needed to create the mutually exclusive tuners.  Here&#8217;s a brief explanation of what this would do.</p>

<p>Normally, I&#8217;ve got my WinTV PVR-250 hooked up to the cable box via svideo, and the channels are changed through firewire.  This lets me record all the channels out of the cable box in analog mode.  This card is also hooked up to the standard cable input and can tune the lower channels just fine.  In addition, I&#8217;m able to pull the firewire HDTV signal from the box onto my computer.  However, as you can now see, when I pull in the firewire HDTV signal, I&#8217;m going to end up changing channels on the WinTV PVR-250 that is getting it&#8217;s signal over firewire.  So, I&#8217;d like to make it so only one of either the WinTV PVR-250 (with SVideo) and the Firewire cable input can be used at the same time.  Furthermore, it would be neat if as an extension, when the Firewire input was in use, it would automatically let my WinTV PVR-250 know that it should use the standard cable tuner input.  I wonder how hard this would be to hack together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While not entirely true, that&#8217;s the gist of what happened.  Last Sunday, October 30th, the machine
was hanging a lot.  After lots of cussing, I decided just to shut the machine off and banish it to
the corner for a while.  When I got back the machine wouldn&#8217;t post and was making a funky smell.
I&#8217;m still not sure if it&#8217;s the motherboard, processor, or power supply.  I hope it&#8217;s just the power
supply.</p>

<p>In any case, it provided a nice excuse to upgrade my computer with new toys.  All of the cards and
drives inside the computer were fine.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t reuse much of the other components such as memory, or rather chose not to
reuse much of it.  Here&#8217;s what I got for the new computer:</p>

<ul>
<li>AMD Athlon 64 3200+ (Venice core)</li>
<li>MSI K8N-Neo4 Platinum Motherboard</li>
<li>XFX GeForce 6600 (256MB ram)</li>
<li>1GB Ram</li>
<li>Antec Overture II Media Center Case</li>
</ul>


<p>Since then I&#8217;ve been fighting to get everything working again.  But it looks like it&#8217;s all basically
going.  We were able to watch the high-definition version of
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/">Monsters Inc.</a> with little problem.  The DVD player
and remote work fine.  I even have it controlling the cable box so we can record digital cable or
high definition right from the cable box.  Tonight I&#8217;m going to get <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV card</a> working on it, provided that
I can actually get XvMC to work properly.  I&#8217;m working on a thorough writeup on how to get MythTV
working in this sorta setup, and I&#8217;ll post it soon.</p>

<p>In the mean time, here are some pictures of the system as I built it and put it in the entertainment
center.  For reference on what the old setup looked like, you may want
to see these pictures:</p>

<p><strong>Update 11/08/2005:</strong> I started writing this yesterday, but didn&#8217;t donwload the
photos until this morning.  In the mean time I&#8217;ve managed to get XvMC working
by beating it into submission using a brute force method.  This means that HDTV
is more or less working, but I can tell that my disk I/O is hurting.  It may
be time to invest in that large RAID 5 array soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I gave another presentation this morning on the Broadcast Flag to the <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">EPP</a> tech policy group.
It wasn&#8217;t my best, perhaps a bit too soft.  I should have spent more time talking about some of the economic analysis of the issues.
Anyway, the slides are <a href="/weblog/misc/20051018-epp-broadcastflag.pdf">available for download</a>.</p>

<p>I did find out one VERY cool thing during this talk.  Another of the students in my department has a much cooler <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>
setup than I do.  In his home country, connected to a $30/month FTTH
link at a friends house he has a MythTV box set up to record
television.  Then utilizing the job queue in MythTV he uploads the programs to his local MythTV system in Pittsburgh and watches it all on XBox frontend.  Wow.  Talk about cool.  He says it takes about 2 hours to get a 1
hour MPEG stream, but still, quite cool and a very interesting use of technology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back at <a href="http://www.iit.edu/">IIT</a> I started an <a href="http://ipro.iit.edu/">IPRO</a>
on pervasive computing under the direction of <a href="http://www.cs.iit.edu/~sun/">Dr. Xian-He Sun</a>.
The project started out as pervasive solutions for classroom use, but eventually morphed into a
cool project called <a href="http://www.hawktour.net/">HawkTour</a>.
It was pretty hard to leave this work because it was a lot of fun and we were creating interesting
new uses of technology.  Well, after I left, they continued in the vision that was laid out with some
of my ideas and lots of AMAZING work by <a href="http://www.tylerbutler.com/">Tyler Butler</a> and
created a cool pervasive computing application that lets you know what is going on in your area
while taking a campus tour.  A few days they got some
<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/10/10/location_tracking____for_people_products_places____is_fast_coming_into_its_own/">great press from the Boston Globe</a>.  This makes me really happy.  Congrats to the folks who are working on this.  It&#8217;s

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve made some pretty good progress on Priblog lately, the biggest change
is that I discovered the magic of <a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>.
SQLObject makes it pretty transparent to access database tables without
writing a single line of SQL.  It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like writing SQL, it&#8217;s
just that when you start writing custom SQL statements, you inevitibly end up
breaking cross platform compatability.  For example, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> has sequences that are used to automatically increment
id counters while <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> has the auto
increment row attribute.</p>

<p>With SQLObject, I just define some new style classes in Python and the
SQLObject layer takes care of everything else for me.  You can even have it
create the tables for you, which means that there is no work on the
part of the user other than making sure that a user can access the database.
What does all this mean for Priblog?  It means that I just added support for
MySQL, sqlite, and a slew of other databases with zero effort.  Sweet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday morning I finally managed to get through to
<a href="http://www.house.gov/doyle/">Congressman Mike Doyle&#8217;s</a> office on the
issue of the broadcast flag.  For once I was even able to speak to his
technical aide on the issue.  The basic gist that I got was that representative Doyle favors the need to
protect copyrighted work from unauthorized distribution on the internet.  Not all that surprising given
his stance on internet decency and censorship.</p>

<p>On the bright side he is in favor of time shifting and allowing us to copy media for personal use.  However,
he doesn&#8217;t seem to understand the ramifications behind this.  Any sort of DRM will inevitibly be broken
and just be a pain for innovation and home users.  I still have to get around to forwarding him the
<a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/DRM2002/darknet5.doc">Darknet paper</a> to better explain the problems
with this logic.  Anyway, I&#8217;m hopeful.  But still, not ideal.</p>
