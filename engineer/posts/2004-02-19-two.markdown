I came to the realization that the current user interface will not be suitable
for what I want it to do.  Also, the entire project had become spaghetti
code becuase of using GLADE for everything.  So with that being said, I started
over on writing my BibTeXML editor today.  It uses glade for some stuff right
now, but that will probably be completely removed in the near future.  PyGTK
makes it easy enough that you really don't need glade.  Anyway, so instead
of the notebooks for each of the views, I'm going to have a notebook for each
file that is open.  Within each file that is open you'll be able to search for
authors, entries etc and also edit them.  Odds are the thing will end up looking
a lot like EndNote by the time I'm done.  I guess that's not a bad thing,
but hopefully it won't look like an alien on my desktop.
