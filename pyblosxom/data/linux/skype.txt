Trying out Skype

After seeing <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog">Edd Dumbill's</a> raving
reviews of <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> I decided to check it out.
Unfortunately, I don't have anyone to call on it.  I can vouch for the fact
that it does indeed start up on my computer.  I should try installing it on
Kristina's computer and see what it can do.  Either that, or I should just
use this as an excuse to call <a href="http://nik.kling.org/">Nik</a>, after
all he's the only one I know who lives abroad right now.
