More Interesting RSS Problems

I just noticed another interesting <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> problem.  Apparently
BlogLines doesn't properly handly article updating as it should.  This means that if it fetches my
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/mythTorrent/mythTorrent.rss">mythTorrent feed</a> while a show is
recording then it will include the show twice, adding it again after the show is completed.  Mainly this
is because the entries for filesize will vary.  The solution to this is to have entries not show up until
after they are finished recording.  Shouldn't be a big deal.  Bear with me, repairs in progress.
