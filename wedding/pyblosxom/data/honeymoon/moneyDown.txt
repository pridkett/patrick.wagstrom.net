Going on a Cruise

It's more or less official, we're going on a cruise on the Caribbean for our Honeymoon.  It's looking like we're taking
the Rhapsody of the Seas on July 18th-25th to Key West, Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  Decided to go a little cheap on the
room but I paid an extra $20 so we weren't on the dungeon level.   Discover card is saving us $160 or on the trip
too because you can double up you're cash on it.
