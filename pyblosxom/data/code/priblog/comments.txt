Comments Added

<p>
Priblog is fast on it's way to Dogfood state.  I've just implemented comments
into the system.  It's not pretty by any stretch of the imagination, but
it seems to work just fine.  They're all foaf-enabled, so you can still have
all your fun by pulling up information for users through the XML interfaces.
In addition, the comment interface is entity agnostic, meaning that that
roughly the same comment system will be used for photos and links too once
I get a chance to add them.  Woot.
