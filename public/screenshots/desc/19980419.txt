The first screenshot I took of <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> Beta 4 to show it to a friend.  There is my REALLY old web page showing there, and I am making the graphics in <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</A> for version 7.0 of <A HREF="http://www.iit.edu/~wagspat/">my web page</A>.</TD>
