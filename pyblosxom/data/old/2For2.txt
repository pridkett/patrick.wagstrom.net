2 For 2

Just a little update.  As of right now, I've heard back from two different Ph.D. programs and I've been accepted into both of them.  I guess that means that I'm 2 for 2.  Which is far better than I fared last year.  I should count my blessings.  Albeit, this whole thing would be much easier if I were only accepted into one program, that way I wouldn't have to make any decisions.
