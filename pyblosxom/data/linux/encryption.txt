Sign My Key Please!

I've recently had the need to start using encryption again.  I've had my
<a href="http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xF78EF927">current
encryption key</a> since 2001, but never really had the need for anyone to
sign it.  So, anyone out there want to sign my key?

Then I can feel like the cool kids.
