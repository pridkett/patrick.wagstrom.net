I've been having some fun with [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) as of late.
 I found out that [Comcast](http://www.comcast.com/) now
offers HDTV in [my neighborhood](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.426597,-79.940171&spn=0.022439,0.045417&t=h&hl=en), so I placed the call.  It was going to cost me
an extra $5.99 a month for HDTV, as I'd need a receiver box.  Bullocks.  Luckily,
[Evan](http://brainflush.blogspot.com/) told me a nifty trick I
could try.  We have just the basic level of cable, costs us $14 or so a month.
Mainly we have it because it ends up saving us $1 off the cable modem bill
($56 for cable modem and basic cable, $57 for cable modem alone).  He said that
he added digital classic to his basic cable for $10 a month, and then got
standard cable with it.  Probably this is due to the use of filters on the
line and the need to remove the filters for digital.  Hmm.

Surprisingly enough, the lady on the other end of the line offered me the
digital class for another $4 a month, bringing the total to $9.99 more a month.
I asked this several times to make sure we weren't getting signed up for
something huge, and she confirmed it.  We'll see if the Evan trick works.  I
also specifically requested a DCT-6200 cable box, with firewire for my
installation, this should still allow me to use an antenna to get CBS, which
I understand is not carried on HDTV on Comcast.  No Steelers in HD sucks.

To complement this, and our upcoming deluge of programs, I realized that the
current 200GB would just not cut it.  Luckily, the folks at
[FatWallet](http://www.fatwallet.com/) found a scorching deal on
a 200GB hard drive from [Outpost](http://www.outpost.com/) for only
$50 after $50 rebate.  Score.  So, we should soon have 400GB of storage on
the MythTV box and HDTV, well we'll have HDTV but not on Myth because I still
can't pick up a new computer yet (for that reason, see my
[progress on reading the Bible](/old/bible/)).  Anyway, here's to
what will hopefully be a nice upgrade.

I also go ambitious and installed Mythweb finally, no you can't see it.  But
to make people happy, I did create a virtual host where you can see what's
coming up on my MythTV box.  Be sure to check out [http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/](http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/)
for all your useless info about my box.  If I could figure out how to make Mythweb
read only, I might make that point to my mythweb install, but not for right now.
Thank you [Apache mod_proxy](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_proxy.html).
