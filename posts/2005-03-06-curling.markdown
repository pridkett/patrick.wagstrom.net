Last night Kristina and I went out with a group of folks from school
to the
[Robert Morris University Island Sports Center](http://www.rmuislandsports.org/)
and hung out with the
[Pittburgh Curling Club](http://www.pittsburghcurlingclub.com/).  It
was different to say the least.  I think every one of us fell down at
least a few times.  But it was definately fun and I think we may
consider doing it again.  At the very least, at $10 a person, it was a
very cheap way to spend a Saturday evening.

Here's two of the shots I took.  Unfortunately, I realized after I left that
the light balance was off.  Also, the PowerShot A75 is not the best for getting
active shots.  Oh yeah, and my batteries died during the evening.  Hopefully
[Paul](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~phines/) got some better shots.
