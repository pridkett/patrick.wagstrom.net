<div class="entry-content"><p>Three years ago I purchased a nice copy of Quicken Deluxe 2002 to help manage my finances.  By and large, I&#8217;ve been fairly happy with it.  There were a few features that I never could get running quite properly, namely <a href="http://www.pncbank.com/">PNC Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.netbank/">NetBank</a>, and allowing it to properly manage my savings bonds.  The PNC problem wasn&#8217;t a big deal because that was our spending cash, so we didn&#8217;t want to track it closely (we each get $100/month in our person accounts there). Savings Bonds I got around by using <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/savwizar.htm">Savings Bond Wizard</a> from the Department of Treasury.  This left me with having to do all the NetBank stuff by hand. I could handle that, but it was less than ideal.</p>

<p>Come earlier this year I got a message in Quicken telling me about the <a href="http://web.intuit.com/support/quicken/sunset/">retirment of online services for Quicken 2002</a>.  After reading the message I realized what they were doing.  They were intentionally breaking software that was only three years old and trying to get me to shell out another $60 for a new version of Quicken.  That&#8217;s dumb.  While I admire Intuit for being one company that has been able to stand up against Microsoft, they&#8217;re not doing a very good job of pleasing their customers. Between this and the Turbo Tax boondagle a few years ago, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to use them anymore.</p>

<p>This left me with a few alternatives.  I&#8217;ve got a copy of Quicken 2004 Basic that I could use.  I&#8217;ve never even installed it, it just sits on my shelf.  It was free when I bought Turbo Tax for my 2003 taxes.  My other options were to try a new program or do it by hand.  Actually, doing it by hand is not an option.  I could move to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx">Microsoft Money</a>, which I&#8217;ve heard good things about, but I don&#8217;t really feel like supporting Microsoft.  That and it&#8217;s a pain to start up <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> every time I want to enter a receipt into my software.</p>

<p>Although I like VMWare, it still sucks having to use it start up my finance software.  The led me to look at finance software that would run on Linux.  I used to use <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GNUCash</a> once upon a time.  But my finances have become a bit more complicated since then, I&#8217;ve got a mutual fund that I need to track, mortgage payments, and car payments to deal with.  Not to mention that I don&#8217;t believe that GNUCash can download statements from my banks or credit cards. Option number two was <a href="http://jgnash.sourceforge.net/">jGnash</a>, some personal finance software written in Java.  It looks pretty nice and the interface seems sane, but once again, I can&#8217;t download my statements.  Suckage.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Java, but am willing to suck it up for something that runs well and does what I need.</p>

<p>The final option I looked at was <a href="http://www.moneydance.com/">Moneydance</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure why this popped back into my head, but I remembered seeing an old <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/28/1811250.shtml?tid=185">slashdot article on Moneydance 2003</a>.  I went to the site, downloaded a trial copy and started playing around with it.  It definately takes some getting used to, but after a short time Moneydance could download most of my account statements. I still haven&#8217;t quite figured out how to get it to download my Fidelity or PNC Bank accounts, but I don&#8217;t track those as closely as I should.  I had no problems importing all of my data from Quicken either.  I just exportedÂ  verything as a QIF file and Moneydance imported it with no difficulty.</p>

<p>Another great thing about Moneydance is that it is <a href="http://moneydance.com/developer.shtml">hackable</a>.  There is a good extension kit available to write extensions in Java and a python shell is available.  Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t been able to find any real python scripts for it.  I wrote a short little test script that prints out the balance of each account in the shell window.  Having a hackable finance program is something I&#8217;ve been in search of for a long time.  I&#8217;d love to have a simple web page I can go to, enter some information about transactions and have my program automatically pull them up next time I open it up.  This seems like it might be doable under Moneydance.  It&#8217;s strange that so many people talk highly of the ability to hack moneydance but never get around to it.  I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll hack it some.  It&#8217;s in my nature.  Not to mention, hacking new UIs using <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> is actually quite nice (I&#8217;ve previously written some UI stuff in Jython for <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/projects/graphs/guess.html">GUESS</a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Moneydance is still closed source, and this is the part that makes baby Richard Stallman cry.  I&#8217;m probably going to shell out the $30 for it regardless.  It&#8217;s supported by basically a one man company, which makes me worry some, but it seems to have an active user community.  In the past Sean Reilly had to finagle with <a href="http://www.appgen.com/">AppGen</a> to get the rights to the software, so I don&#8217;t imagine he&#8217;s going to give up on them that fast.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve finally got a piece of personal finance software that I don&#8217;t feel filthy dirty for using and that runs on Linux.  I guess it&#8217;s a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>As for my savings bonds issue, that&#8217;s a completely moot point because of the most excellent <a href="http://gbonds.sf.net/">GBonds</a> program.  I highly recommend it for folks using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop.</p>
