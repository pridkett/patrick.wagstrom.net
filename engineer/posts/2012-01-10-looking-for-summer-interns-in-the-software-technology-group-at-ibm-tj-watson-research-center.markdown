Are you one of the best software engineering students in the world? Do you dig mining software repositories? Are you a wizard at social network analysis? Interested in a great summer job looking at what makes software teams work? Even better, want to work with me?

[The Software Technologies Group at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, NY is looking for summer interns!](http://researcher.ibm.com/view_project.php?id=1811) I started at IBM back in 2007 as an intern and had a great time meeting some of the smartest students from around the world. Students are given a chance to work with the best technology in the world and often end submitting papers to ICSE, CHI, CSCW, or FSE as a result of their work with us.

We suggest that you [apply online](https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/job_summary.jsp?job_id=RES-0451733). If you've got questions you can email directly for more information. But hurry up, as we're going to start our selection and interview process soon.

PS. For faculty, this is a great way offload students for the summer if you'd like to take off to St. Barth's for a few months.
