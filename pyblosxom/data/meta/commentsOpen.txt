In the dark old days of the internet, I used to run a weblog using a few ad
hoc PHP scripts.  They broke a lot and generally weren't well maintained.  Somtime
later I started to use <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>.
After all, it was 2001, and that was all the rage back then.  However, as a
devotee of the "Dump Perl for the good of all humanity" movement, I wan't too
keen about running a set of Perl CGI scripts on my webserver.  Don't get me
wrong, Movable Type was great and all, but it was still Perl.  Which meant
it was nigh impossible to hack on.  Sometime later, with the release of
Movable Type version 3, the license changed to something that was decidely
un-free and un-cool.  I don't remember the details, but I just remember not
particularly liking the change.

In late summer of 2003 I moved to Pittsburgh, and for a few months, my entire
website went dark.  Then it came back online using some hokey methods to make
it accessible on my Verizon DSL line.  I began to search for a new weblog system
that met most of my requirements.  Namely, that it was written in Python, because
that was my language du jour at the time (and for the most part, still is).  I
found lots of different options, but none seemed really complete.  I finally
settled on <a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">PyBlosxom</a>.  It was
completely file based, so it seemed pretty simple to setup.  Almost everything
was done via plugins, which also was quite cool.  It was a pretty minimalistic
weblog system.  For the most part it worked for me.
</p>
<p>
As time went on, I added some new features to PyBlosxom, and saw the software move
into the life support stage of development.  The original architecture was pretty
cool, but it wasn't quite structured the right way for all the stuff I wanted to
do.  I undertook a painful process to augment the infrastructure of Pyblosxom to
give it some XML/XSLT rendering framework, and produce what you see today.  I find
it marginally a pain to administer, but it works for the most part.  Anyway,
since switching to PyBlosxom, I've lacked the ability to allow for reader comments
on the page.  I'm not sure why, probably because I was getting lots of spam on my
Movable Type weblog back in the day.  However, a lot has changed with weblogs in
the three and a half years that I've used PyBlosxom, and the time has come to
hack together more stuff into my PyBlosxom implementation.  That's right, effective
today, commenting exists once again.  Halleluja!
</p>
<p>
The commenting system isn't perfect.  It basically translates every message into
plain text, replacing carriage returns with &lt;br&gt; tags, but it seems to work
well enough.  Consider it to be another ball of duct tape on top of the mess of
scripts that holds this website together.  Anyway, so feel free to try and leave
some comments.  If people really hammer the system, I'll probably be forced to
modify the script for more anti-spam stuff and what not.  For right now, I'm
counting on the fact that the system is unique to keep the spambots away.
And with that, let the conversations (or lack thereof) begin.
