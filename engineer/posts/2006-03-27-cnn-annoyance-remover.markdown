I admit, I'm a [CNN.com](http://www.cnn.com/) news junky.  In the
past I used a combination of Firefox, AdBlock, and Privoxy to keep their
annoyances to a minimum.  Then yesterday they dropped the bomb.  Ack, their
new site is just annoying.  I don't care about the videos or gratuitous crap
they put about podcasts and what not.  I visit it in my browser for the news.
So what's a guy to do?

Well, when you're bored in class, one easy thing to do is to write a
[Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) user script.  Simply
[download cnnMod.user.js](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/projects/personal/firefox/greasemonkey/cnnMod.user.js) once you've installed greasemonkey and watch all sorts of
annoying elements be zapped.  Have fun kids.  If you've got suggestions,
let me know and I'll add them in.
