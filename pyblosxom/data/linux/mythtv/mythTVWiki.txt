MythTV Wiki

I set up a <a href="http://myth.wagstrom.net/">MythTV Wiki</a> today.  I should be doing work.  But I guess
this was a nice little distraction.  If you're a <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUGer</a> who just got
a card stop by and help me fill in some details.

I'm aware that there is already a <a href="http://www.mythtv.info/">general MythTV wiki</a> but something
about that just bothers me.  It is of such poor quality, and really <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a> is so much nicer than 
<a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> (I'm saying this even as a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> lover).  Anyway, for folks just randomly browsing the web,
feel free to add to it.  It's glacially slow right now.  Sorry, it's running on my 200MHz box.  I'll see
about moving it something faster later.
