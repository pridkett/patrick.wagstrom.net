One of the blogs I frequently read is the [Make: Magazine](http://www.makezine.com/) blog. Today I noticed when reading it that one of the topics was [How to make a combination composite/component cable for the Wii](http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/12/how_to_nintendo.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890).  "Wow," I thought, "someone else had the same idea as me!".  Looking at the first picture, I was like, "This looks really familiar."  Well, if it looked familiar, that's because it was my writeup.  Yay.  I made it into Make's blog.  I feel special.  Thanks for your support.
