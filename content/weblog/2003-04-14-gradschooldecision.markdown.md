So I've made my decision.  Next fall I'm going to be starting the Ph.D. program
in [Engineering and Public Policy](http://www.epp.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie
Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu/).  The problem is that Pennsylvania is ass
backwards and has a law that says that I can't bring [my hedgehogs](/hedghogs/)
with me.  So if you might be interested in giving either one a home, let me
know.  Thanks.
