This has to be one of the most intereseting social engineering efforts that I've ever seen.  Apparently some people in New York are organizing themselves to all show up at a particular store for 10 minutes, the miracuously disperse.  There is more information over at <a href="http://www.cheesebikini.com/blog/archives/000261.html">cheesebikini</a>.

I think this is an interesting concept, but the person organizing seems to be rather put off that someone called the cops last time.  I'd be pissed off too.  It's a perfectly safe gathering of people.  It's probably going to be good business for the businesses involved because they see lots of people coming in and out.  And best of all, it's meant to be safe.  Don't cops have better things to do, like busting child molestors or thieves?  Oh well, welcome to Ashcroft's America.
