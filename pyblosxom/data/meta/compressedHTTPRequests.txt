Compressing HTTP Requests

On my quest playing with compression of HTTP stuff, I found out today that it is possible
to compress the request to a server in addition to the response.  While for most cases this
wouldn't matter much, as requests are small, for web-dav clients this can be a very big
deal.  Basically the difference is that a client sends an additional header that says
<my:verbatim>Content-Encoding: gzip</my:verbatim> to the server (this also means they need
to seend a <my:verbatim>Content-Length</my:verbatim> header too) and the server if it
can handle that will automatically upack the body of the request.  Wow, that's just cool.
