I'm a little sad.  [Hurricane Electric](http://www.he.net/) had to filter IRC traffic over their [TunnelBroker](http://www.tunnelbroker.net/) IPv6 service.  Apparently some people were doing dos attacks with it.  That makes me sad, I enjoyed it because I could set my own reverse DNS. I still can for IPv6, but I just can't use IRC through IPv6 anymore.
