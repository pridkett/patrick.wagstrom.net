The Sacramento Bee has a good [opinon
article](http://www.sacbee.com/content/opinion/story/7837475p-8778055c.html)
written by a county clerk/recorder and UC-Davis Law School faculty member that
explain some of the big programs behind the Help America Vote Act and why all
these touch screen devices are bad news.  It catalogs the big three e-voting
companies and how none of them deserve your trust.  I highly recommend it.
