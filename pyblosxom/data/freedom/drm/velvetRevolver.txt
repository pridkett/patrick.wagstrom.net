DRM a Success, I think Not.

BMG has been putting the full spin about the new release from Velvet Revolver,
the band consisting of non-Axl Guns N' Roses and Scott Weiland from Stone Temple
Pilots.  They claim that the large sales of the album, incidentally protected with
shift-key-bypassable-SunnComm, means that people are accepting the DRM.  But that's
probably not the case, most people don't realize that the album has this copy
protection on it.  Furthermore, the copy protection is supposed to prevent users
from ripping the albums to MP3, but that only works on Windows PCs, a Mac or Linux
can still rip the CD, eliminating the whole problem.

The fact of the matter is that BMG has declared war on our rights of fair use.  How
long until they'll also attack our right of first sale for CDs.  Frankly this was
the one CD I was considereing getting this year, but I'm gonna pass now.  You can
read a lot more information with some analysis from the Amazon reviews at
