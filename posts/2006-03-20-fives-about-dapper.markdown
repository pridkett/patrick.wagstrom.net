[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) 06.06 (note the delay from the original 06.04), aka Dapper Drake,
is well into development, and being as I have a shiny new laptop, I decided to give it a shot.  So,
here's a list of five things that I like about Dapper and five things that could use some work.  Many of
these aren't necessary Dapper specific, but they're things that I didn't do with Breezy (or Hoary, or Warty...).

**Five Things That Rock**

  1. [deskbar applet](http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/) - totally changes the way you use your computer.  Alt-F3 is your friend.
  2. [NetworkManager](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/)
  3. Improved startup time
  4. [Banshee](http://www.banshee-project.org/Main_Page) and iPod transcoding
  5. SSHFS doesn't crash in Nautilus

**Five things that need help**

  1. gtkmozembed needs some serious help - breaks [Blam!](http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Blam) and [Liferea](http://liferea.sourceforge.net/)
  2. Sleep/Hibernate not so hot on my T43p
  3. xgl halts my T43p
  4. No built in support for fingerprint scanner (but it does work)
  5. NetworkManager tends to halt sometimes - especially if I unplug the network cable

Overall I'm really impressed.  I'm hoping that by the May [WPLUG](http://www.wplug.org/) installfest
I can have [xgl](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xgl) working and all bugs hammered out.  Of
course, my dream for a Ubuntu focused installfest is dead because
[Dapper is delayed](http://lwn.net/Articles/175272/).
