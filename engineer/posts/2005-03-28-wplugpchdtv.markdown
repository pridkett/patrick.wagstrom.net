I'm organizing a mass purchase of [pcHDTV 3000](http://www.pchdtv.com/) HDTV tuner cards for folks in WPLUG.  The more we buy, the cheaper they go.  I'm hoping to get an order for 10 or so.  That way we get about $25 off per card!  Wowza!  Take a look at the [current sale status](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/pwagstro/pchdtv.html).  If you're interested in a few cards and are not a [WPLUG](http://www.wplug.org/) member, email me and I'll see what I can do for you.

Remember, buy them before July 1, or don't buy them at all.  Yay for the wonderful [Broadcast Flag](http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/)! Protect your fair use rights today!
