So last night I got distracted and started playing with rendezvous, but the
library I was using didn't work under OpenBSD, so I started to hack at it to
get it to work, and I got almost there, but was having problems with a
dead interface card on the server.  So I removed the configuration, but this
caused the server to hang, so I changed the settings, but when the box
came back it's gateway was all messed.  So long story short, for about 12
hours today the box was routing packets back to the outside world.  It got
better around 1pm today or so.  Thanks in large part to being able to
reconfigure and OpenBSD kernel on the fly.
