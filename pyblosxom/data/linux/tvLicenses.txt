My Parent's TV Runs Linux

My parents recently purchased a new house in the exurbs.  So far out that
Google maps doesn't have any photos for the four highest settings.  It's
44 miles one-way to the nearest mall.  Yup, that's the middle of nowhere.
My Dad built a nice set of cabinets for their living room.  Including a
a mantle over the natural gas fireplace.  When they moved in, unfortunately,
their old TV didn't fit.  It hung over the front edge about half an inch.
Clearly this was not acceptable.  The only rememdy, go out and buy a big
badass flat panel TV.  And they got a nice good one, I believe its the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007WKB4G/002-3775664-1979212?v=glance">Panasonic TH-37PX50U</a>; a 37 inch widescreen plasma screen.  I'm jealous.

Unfortunately, it's stuck in the stretch aspect ratio, which means that all
4:3 content gets stretch to its 16:9 dimensions, kinda strange.  Anyway, I
was trying to fix this by playing around in the menus when I found that there
was option for "license".  Naturally I clicked on it.

The problem is, I could not figure out how to get the screen to pull up
the GPL or LGPL, which would have been kinda cool.  But alas, no dice.
Furthermore, when visiting <a href="http://www.am-linux.jp/dl/DTV05U">http://www.am-linux.jp/dl/DTV05U</a> one is greeted with a nice 404 error.  That's
just not cool.  I even tried switching the model from DTV05U to DTVO5U, but
it still didn't work.  Crapola.  So then I visited <a href="http://www.am-linux.jp/">http://www.am-linux.jp/</a> which makes me wonder again, WTF is wrong with
Japaneese people.  Really, why do those bunnies need to be there?!  I even
followed the click stream looking for the USA software and couldn't find
anything.  Sigh.  The Japaneese stuff is there at least.
