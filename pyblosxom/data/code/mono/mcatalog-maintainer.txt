Apparently some of my original emails to Cesar, the author of
<a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/">MCatalog</a> got
lost in transit, or his replies did, or something.  Anyway, after my
requests, Cesar asked if I would like to maintain MCatalog, I agreed
to the task.  So that will make my branch of MCatalog more or less the
official trunk of MCatalog.

I wish I could say something like "To celebrate the momentus occassion,
I present to you MCatalog 0.3," but I can't.  I had a few <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/milestone/0.3">issues marked for 0.3</a>,
but when they were all resolved it didn't feel like a new release.  At least,
not a jump from 0.2 to 0.3, maybe a 0.2.1 release or something.  So, I went
and added more stuff to my todo list of 0.3.  Anyway, look for a release in
the next few weeks.  Also, please download it, try it out, and give it some
love.  It compiles pretty easily once you've added the <my:verbatim>mono-dev</my:verbatim> package in <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Dapper.
