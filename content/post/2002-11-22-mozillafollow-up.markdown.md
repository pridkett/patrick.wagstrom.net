Okay, so I tried to contact these people and the addresses bounced, go figure.
Here is the followup email that I just sent to their
[techsupport](mailto:helpdesk@iit.ecollege.com) and
[evaluation@iit.edu](mailto:evaluation@iit.edu).

    This is a followup to a phone call I just had with your technical
    support people.  The first issue is that of email addresses on this
    page:

    http://iit.ecollege.com/pubinclude/ErrMessaging.asp?Error_Type=13&LTID=A&ClientID=&ClientString=&URL=A%5FPSH%2Ereal&browser=Netscape&version=5

    It tells me to email techsupport@realed.com, but this is the response
    that I receive:

    It's clear to see that the problem resides on your side, as it got to
    postmaster@ecollege.com and then bounced.  Please fix this error as soon
    as possible.

    Secondly is the larger issue of browser support, here is the original
    email that I tried to send to you regarding browser support.

    The conversation that I had with your help desk representative was
    moderately helpful, and he explained that you hadn't tested support for
    anything beyond Netscape 4.x.  While I understand the need to QA
    material, I also feel the need to inform you of the substantial minority
    at technical Universities, such as IIT, that use Linux as their
    operating system, and thus probably also use a Mozilla based browser.
    Yet when I went to call technical support I was only given the option of
    being a Mac or a Windows user.

    Not daunted, and being secure in the fact that I run a standards
    compliant browser, I hit the button on the afformentioned page, that
    said try logging anywya.  Only to be presented with a 404/Not Found
    error from your webserver as it attempts to access this page:

    http://iit.ecollege.com/A_PSH.real?ClientID=577661&ClientString=iit&47wagspat

    I'm finding this whole thing a little disturbing.

    Also, why isn't such information encrypted over transit?  We are
    transmitting personal information on the login page, yet it is not
    secure.  This is more than a little disturbing.

    I've attached the error page.  The graphics are broken on it when I look
    at it on the server too, and the links for email addresses aren't mailto
    links like they should be, instead they take me to yet another 404/Not
    Found page.

    I'm trying to be very patient here, but some of this seems to be just
    outright negligence.  I've attached the page it gives me as an error.

    Peace,

    Patrick
