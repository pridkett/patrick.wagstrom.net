Now both my desktop at school and my desktop at home have KDE-3.1 (at home it was thanks to apt for redhat).  I was going to set up some NFS stuff to share my files at home with my computer at school, but that is sorta a pain.  I've discovered that KDE 3.1 has a very cool ioslave called fish.  With fish you can type fish://patrick@my.server.com/home/patrick/Documents/myfile.txt and get access to the file.  It even allows for browsing of the file and everything.  Overall it is very cool.

(yes, I know that emacs has had something similar with tramp mode for a very long time...I've used tramp mode, and it works pretty slick to, but that's just emacs; whereas a KDE ioslave can be used in any kde app)
