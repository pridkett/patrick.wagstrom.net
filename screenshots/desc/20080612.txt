It's been a really long time since I took a screenshot of my desktop.  Oddly enough, you'll notice that it doesn't look that much different than the desktops looked four or five years ago.  So much for progress.  Of course, I'm also running on about the same machine that I had four years ago too.  This is <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Hardy</a> running <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>.  The apps you see up are <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> in <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twihrl</a> a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a> client written in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe Air</a>.
