I've recently had the need to start using encryption again.  I've had my
[current
encryption key](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xF78EF927) since 2001, but never really had the need for anyone to
sign it.  So, anyone out there want to sign my key?






Then I can feel like the cool kids.
