  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m in the process of getting rid of a bunch of stuff laying around the
house.  One of these things that I&#8217;ll never use again is my Parallel Port
zip drive.  In fact, I haven&#8217;t been able to use it for the last three years
because I lost the power supply.  Last spring, <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">my department</a> was giving away some stuff, and one of them was a zip drive.
At the time I thought it was another parallel port one, but really it was
a SCSI one, with the 25 pin scsi connector, which is the exact same thing
as a parallel cable.  Anyway, long story short, I&#8217;ve been using the power
supply from the SCSI drive to power my parallel port drive and then dump the
data that&#8217;s relevant back to my hard disk.</p>

<p>Some of this stuff is personal stuff, photos from college that I already
have stored elsewhere, letters, etc.  Some of it is old stuff from when I
worked at <a href="http://www.lecltd.com/">LEC Ltd</a> and <a href="http://www.mypoints.com/">MyPoints</a>, and some of it is REALLY old &#8211; like my phone
listing from Telemate 4.22 and Telix 3.11; apparently the Gate&#8217;s three lines
were 858-8218, 858-8219, and 858-8260.  In any case, I&#8217;m not so silly
as to think that moving the files off the disks really deletes them (see
<a href="http://www.simson.net/clips/2003/2003.CSO.04.Hard_disk_risk.htm">this article by Simson Garfinkel</a> or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4229550.stm">this article from the BBC</a> for more info).</p>

<p>Of course, the proper solution is to do <code>dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda4</code> a couple of times.  But this is really slow.  You can speed
it up by doing <code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda4</code>, and
just hope that no one cracks the pseudo-random nature of <code>/dev/urandom</code>.  But
this still can&#8217;t deal with the issue that my parallel port zip drive is REALLY
REALLY slow.  I&#8217;m lazy, impatient, and most importantly, intolerant of my
system coming to a crawl while dumping data to the parallel port.</p>

<p>The next step was to try some big magnets.  My father-in-law repairs appliances
and gave us a bunch of microwave magnetron magnets.  They&#8217;re mega strong.  I
piled them around the disks and shuffled the pile for a few minutes, but the
disks still read.  I&#8217;m lazy, I just want to make retreiving the data
sufficiently difficult without having to wait forever.  Enter RandomWipe.</p>

<p>RandomWipe is a simple little python script that randomly rewrites locations
on a disk with crap from <code>/dev/urandom</code>.  You can also have it write over the
initial section of the disk too.  Really quite nice.  Here&#8217;s the code for
RandomWipe, which I place in the public domain and disclaim all warranty on.
Please note, only this snippet of python code below is in the public domain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been running it using the following set of commands:
<code>python randomwipe.py /dev/sda4 -b 4096 -i 500 -f &amp;&amp; mount -t vfat /dev/sda4 /mnt/image &amp;&amp; umount /dev/sda4; mkfs.vfat /dev/sda4</code>.
This basically goes and writes 4096 bytes of random data in 500 different
locations on the disk and additionally blows away the beginning of the file
allocation table.  It then attempts a mount just to make sure and finally
creates a new filesystem on the disk.  I can process a disk in about a minute
like this with a reasonable assurance of security (what I call good enough).</p>

<p>As an aside, if you&#8217;re interested in the drives (parallel and scsi) along with
14 100MB disks, let me know.  I give discounts to blog readers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of the <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">EPP</a> Ph.D. program, each student
spends a semester a manages an undergraduate student project.  These are very broad
projects and the final project is a 100-200 page report on the topic.  In the past
they&#8217;ve covered issues such as brownfields leeching into Pittsburgh, hybrid vehicles,
and emergency response stuff.  This semester, I got recruited to help out with a
project on Spyware.  Apparently I&#8217;m the most qualified grad student they could find
right now.  This isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;m not qualified for it, but it was with a bit of
reluctance that I took on the task.  It should be a good time.</p>

<p>To get the students familiar I&#8217;ve decided to infect my laptop with as much spyware as
I can find.  Well, not really.  My laptop runs Linux and there isn&#8217;t much spyware for
Linux.  But I do have <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>, which lets me run
Windows in a virtual machine.  It also lets me checkpoint the system and roll it back
from a spyware infection, really a great technique for testing.  As another bonus, I
can then capture all traffic to the network using <a href="http://www.ethereal.org/">Ethereal</a>.</p>

<p>So here comes my problem, it&#8217;s actually rather hard to get my computer infect with
spyware.  I&#8217;ve managed to find the old versions of Kazaa and Bearshare, which should
do an okay job.  I&#8217;ve also found the funwebproducts stuff too.  But I&#8217;d like some REALLY
mean stuff.  So, if anyone knows of something that&#8217;s a downright trojan, like connects
to a remote IRC server and becomes a bot slave, let me know, or zip it up and email it
to me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My parents recently purchased a new house in the exurbs.  So far out that Google maps doesn&#8217;t have any photos for the four highest settings.  It&#8217;s 44 miles one-way to the nearest mall.  Yup, that&#8217;s the middle of nowhere. My Dad built a nice set of cabinets for their living room.  Including a a mantle over the natural gas fireplace.  When they moved in, unfortunately, their old TV didn&#8217;t fit.  It hung over the front edge about half an inch. Clearly this was not acceptable.  The only  remedy, go out and buy a big badass flat panel TV.  And they got a nice good one, I believe its the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0007WKB4G/002-3775664-1979212?v=glance">Panasonic TH-37PX50U</a>; a 37 inch widescreen plasma screen.  I&#8217;m jealous.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s stuck in the stretch aspect ratio, which means that all 4:3 content gets stretch to its 16:9 dimensions, kinda strange.  Anyway, I was trying to fix this by playing around in the menus when I found that there was option for &#8220;license&#8221;.  Naturally I clicked on it.</p>

<p>The problem is, I could not figure out how to get the screen to pull up the GPL or LGPL, which would have been kinda cool.  But alas, no dice. Furthermore, when visiting <a href="http://www.am-linux.jp/dl/DTV05U">http://www.am-linux.jp/dl/DTV05U</a> one is greeted with a nice 404 error.  That&#8217;s just not cool.  I even tried switching the model from DTV05U to DTVO5U, but it still didn&#8217;t work.  Crapola.  So then I visited <a href="http://www.am-linux.jp/">http://www.am-linux.jp/</a> which makes me wonder again, WTF is wrong with Japaneese people.  Really, why do those bunnies need to be there?!  I even followed the click stream looking for the USA software and couldn&#8217;t find anything.  Sigh.  The Japaneese stuff is there at least.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was a geek and nerd back in <a href="http://www.whitebear.k12.mn.us/hssc/southmenu/index.htm">High School</a>.  Yes, I played tennis, but only at the JV
level, and even then I sucked.  Most of my stuff was nerdy like <a href="http://www.macalester.edu/mathleague/">Math Team</a>,
<a href="http://www.mnacadsci.org/Events/Olympiad/soHome.asp">Science Olympiad</a>,
<a href="http://www.odysseyofthemind.com/">Oddyssey of the Mind</a>, and Speech team.  Yup, at must schools I would have been a walking
wedgie.  Fortunately, my high school was pretty cool about that stuff, so
I escaped with no ripped pairs of underwear.</p>

<p>One of the nerdy things I did for three years was <a href="http://www2.mnbar.org/mocktrial/">Mock Trial</a>.  Basically we&#8217;d
play lawyers and witnesses and try to argue our case persuasively before a
panel of real lawyers.  The cases were standardized through the state and were
distributed in a case book with depositions and background material.  The
witnesses role was to convincingly present their information, while the lawyers
had to dig it out.  Of course, each witness had juicy bits for both sides
in their deposition.</p>

<p>In 1996 (I think), the case dealt with a high schooler who was shot by a
police officer named Sidney (convinently, all witnesses had gender neutral
names).  Our primary defense team consisted of Jeff Firkell (Sidney) and Eric
Myers (defense lawyer); I was on the prosecution, so I&#8217;m not really involved in this story.  Now, neither of these two
fellows was what one could call serious, in even the most loose interpretation
of the word.  This worked out very well because witnesses were basically
given free reign to make their responses up if the question was from outside
the scope of the deposition.</p>

<p>One of Jeff&#8217;s biggest gems comes from a response to a question from the
opposing lawyer that was something like &#8220;So officer Sidney, why, if you had
a chance to aim, did you aim for the students arm instead of their knee?&#8221;  To
which Jeff took the liberty of replying &#8220;Well, you see, I was shot in the knee
in Nam and wouldn&#8217;t wish that on anyone,&#8221; and then faked a series of twitches
that would be the result of his traumatic experience.</p>

<p>But no, that&#8217;s not the actual target of this entry.  Rather, there is a
much better gem that I wish to describe.  The prosecution had been haranging
Sidney about why he was near the fast food restaurant when he was supposed
to be working at the school.  No information was presented about the
restuarant, but the question was designed to discredit Sidney&#8217;s work ethic.</p>

<p>Now, there was a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.049444,-93.009535&amp;spn=0.005206,0.011354&amp;t=h&amp;saddr=3551+Mcknight+rd,+55110&amp;daddr=2064+County+Road+E+E,+St+Paul,+MN+55110&amp;hl=en">McDonald&#8217;s right next to our school</a>.  We had
our suspicions about its location, knowing that many people skipped cafeteria
lunch and went there instead.  Eric, the astute chap he was asked Jeff/Sidney
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you agree that McDonalds are strategically located near schools?&#8221;.
No objection was raised.  Sidney replied that yes it was and he was just
checking on truant students.  We won the case.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise today when I see that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/diet.fitness/08/26/fast.food.schools.ap/index.html">fast food really does cluster near schools</a>.
Yes folks, your research was predicted by Eric Myers nine years ago.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s was a hot and humid weekend in Pittsburgh this weekend.  On such a
Friday evening what&#8217;s
a group if mid-twentysomething married couples of graduate students
supposed to do?  Simple.  Go see what sort of fun we can find out
in Pennsyltucky!</p>

<p>This last week was the <a href="http://www.butlerfarmshow.com/">Butler Farm Show</a>, and boy was it an experience.  Apparently, everyone up in
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=butler,+pa&amp;hl=en">Butler</a> goes
to this basically every night, because it was packed.  Admission was the
bargain basement price of $7, plus $2 to get access to arena events.  While
that might initially seem kinda steep, it provided unlimited rides, which
means quality time with carnies!</p>

<p>Of course, as liberal graduate students, we fit right in with our tiny
Mazda3 and Bill&#8217;s Volvo station
wagon parked between the rows of pick-up ktrucks with the extra tires in the
back for pulling horse trailers, gun racks in the back window, and the
occassional confederate flag bumper sticker.  Once inside we could have easily been
mistaken for the locals with their &#8220;If at first you don&#8217;t secede&#8221; T-shirts
and copious amounts of yellow ribbons.</p>

<p>So why would a group of what is primarily environmental hippies (all the other
grad students did stuff with the environment, I was the only geek) brave
possible death and maiming?  Two words, DEMOLITION DERBY!</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/demolitionDerby1.jpg">
<img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/demolitionDerby2.jpg">
<img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/demolitionDerby3.jpg"></p>

<p>Nothing is more relaxing than watching Pennsyltuckians take cars and beat
the hell out of each other by ramming them at moderately high speeds.  There
were no flips or flying body parts, but profuse amounts of screeches, popped tires, and even a few little fires.  It&#8217;s a little disappointing because
the system is set up where it&#8217;s advantageous to be on the periphery and not
that active.  Frequently the winner of each round had just sat on the side of
the arena until the refs began to count them out for inactivity.  They need a better scoring system, so folks who really do damage,
which of course the crowd loves, can somehow go on.  Unfortunately, that
means they would have to get their cars going again for future rounds.</p>

<p>There were three main rounds, where &#8220;fresh&#8221; cars were used.  A fourth round
featured second chances, where drivers from previous rounds who somehow could
get their car going again after their round, could try again.  The last two
people driving and hitting from each stage then went on to the fifth and
final stage.  Unlike previous stages, there would be only one one winner.
The last car moving was to be the winner.</p>

<p>In this spirit, the demolition derby ended with two cars banging the hell out
of each other and chasing each other around the arena.  Finally, the cars
revved up and ran at each other head one to massive applause and a wonderful
crash.  And&#8230;a TIE?!  WTF?  The head on collision disabled both cards.
 They don&#8217;t even have ties in Hockey anymore.  Nestor&#8217;s repeated appeals for
hand to hand combat were rejected.</p>

<p>Without a doubt, we&#8217;re going again next year.  It&#8217;s one of those things
that would be hella cool to do sometime too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a follow-up on the origin of
<a href="/weblog/weblog/2005/08/effChinaHats">my EFF hat</a>.  Apparently the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>
didn&#8217;t even consider where the hats were made when they started, which is pretty
normal for most folks.  They simply searched for the best deal.  It sounds like
they have a decent amount of hats stored up still that they will continue to
distribute rather than dispose of; that makes sense.  In fairness to the EFF,
my impression is that these were part of bulk order a while back.  Possibly
before China got really draconian with beefing up the firewall and shutting
down netcafes, and maybe even before the blog explosion of the last two years which they&#8217;ve fought
desperately to control.</p>

<p>It just shows, it&#8217;s difficult to know where products are made and it&#8217;s difficult
not to support regimes that you don&#8217;t agree with or that violate human rights.
Other big exporters, such as Indonesia and Malaysia also have their own human
rights issues.  We could also resort to saying buy American, but then we&#8217;re
also deluding ourselves to a degree.  I suppose at least with capitalist
countries you&#8217;re not really supporting the oppression like you may be with
communist nations.  Intuitively I would think that shopping at <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">Ikea</a>
would be fine, but I just looked a few Ikea picture frames; made in China.</p>

<p>Thanks to whichever one of my blog readers gave the helpful pointer to the EFF.
I noticed that they looked at the weblog entry from last night and in the email
they made a comment about persevering after no response.  Thanks to the EFF for taking time to
respond.  You guys and girls rock.  Thanks for fighting the good fights.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a proud supporter of the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> at a level that is probably much higher than my income should support.  But in general, their work is really valuable and I  appreciate all that they do.  Last year when I made my donation, I even got some nifty schwag to go with it, a nice EFF Swat Hat, as seen below.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/effHat.jpg"></p>

<p>It sat unused for well over a year, as I had a nice bucket hat that would get worn when I was outside for extended periods.  I really liked that hat.  I had owned it for about five or six years.  It was broken in.  It had history.  It fit <a href="/weblog/weblog/politics/myEnormousMelon.xml">my enormous melon</a>.  Unfortunately, due to the ineptitude of United/Lufthansa/Air Dolomiti in delivering my luggage to me in Genoa last month (or in Pittsburgh this month), it appears my beloved bucket hat is taking a permanent vacation in the Munich or Frankfurt airports.  Initially I thought this was not going to be a huge problem as I don&#8217;t wear hats that often.  But then something different came up, baseball and tailgating with Kristina&#8217;s department.  I needed a hat.  Seeing the only hat that I owned, I threw it on.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/meInBucketHat.jpg"></p>

<p>It actually was kinda cool, lots of folks asked about the EFF and I was able to tell them a little bit about what the EFF does.  Usually they just shrugged and walked off, probably thinking &#8220;this guy is a geek&#8221;.  Whatever, they&#8217;re chemical engineers.   Anyway, I did some examination of the tag and this is what I found:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2005/08/effHatTag.jpg"></p>

<p>Made where?  In China?!  Maybe this hit me on my bad side or something.  I really don&#8217;t like China.  I don&#8217;t like how they abuse their citizens.  I don&#8217;t like how they&#8217;re communist.  I don&#8217;t like their cheap products.  In most cases I&#8217;m even willing to pay a decent premium to avoid buying Chinese products. Furthermore, if one <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeff.org+china">queries Dr. Google</a> you get a lot of links the EFF&#8217;s site, almost of none of them good.  China engages in draconian censorship and supression of free speech.  I can&#8217;t believe that the EFF would support them like this (don&#8217;t delude yourself, any piece of <a href="http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/archives/001654.html">cheap chinese shit</a> you buy supports communism).</p>

<p>As the activist the armchair activist that I&#8217;ve become, I did what came natural, an email off to the EFF information address.  In the past I&#8217;ve gotten quick responses on issues to this address.  This was sent a few weeks ago, and I have yet to receive a response.  Even a terse message like  &#8220;we have no policy toward China.&#8221; would be welcome.</p>

Subject:    EFF "SWAT" hat and China
Date:   Mon, 25 Jul 2005 11:28:50 -0400

Hi,

About a year ago I received an EFF "SWAT" hat as shwag for my membership
donation to the EFF.  I really haven't worn the hat all that much, in
fact this weekend was the first time.  I took a close look at the label
and saw that it was made in China.  Now, I don't think that I'm some
sort of anti-China nutcase, but I believe there is an issue with an
organization like the EFF, that promotes freedom on the net, supporting
products from a nation that works so hard to censor the net and keep
controls on information.  Is China not one of the most oppressive
regimes when it comes to information dissemination?

Does the EFF have a policy about using products or goods from China?

Thanks,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So it&#8217;s been a while since I wrote what I&#8217;ve been hacking away on.  The biggest
thing is that I&#8217;ve been trying to add license support to
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/f-spot/">F-spot</a>.  It&#8217;s not that
difficult to do, but the architecture doesn&#8217;t support changing the schema
all that much.  The thought is that there will be another category of
things like tags, just licenses.  Right now each photo can have a single
license associated with it.</p>

<p>Each of the licenses then has a set of properties that are basically taken
from the <a href="http://www.creatvecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses.
In the future, this will allow you to select only those photos that allow
commercial use, or something like that.  Maybe when we combie it with the
Flickr export, your photos will automagically keep their licenses.  All sorts
of neato possibilities.  I just need to find to hack on it some more.  Research
is burying me.</p>

<p>On the research front, I&#8217;ve been hacking away at my scripts to automatically
build social networks for OSS projects.  It&#8217;s all very cool.   Give it a URL
and it just goes out and builds lots of useful information from these networks.
I&#8217;ve been integrating information from a copy of the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME CVS</a> repository that I recently got.
GNOME is a MASSIVE project.  There&#8217;s about 500,000 different files in the
complete CVS repository.  That&#8217;s a lot of analysis.  It&#8217;s even bogging down
our dual opteron server.  Yikes.</p>

<p>On the home front, I&#8217;ve been exploring how to get nice DVDs burned from movies
that I&#8217;ve recorded with MythTV.  Unfortunately, my 200GB hard disk is nearly
full and I need to rememdy that soon.  Right now I&#8217;ve been deleting crappy
stuff like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102216/">King Ralph</a>,
but I&#8217;ve got a finite number of crappy movies.  It&#8217;s probably more practical
to start buring TV shows to DVD.  But I need to burn a lot of Simpsons episodes
to DVD to start freeing up space.  Of course, the other option is to wait
and get a bigger hard drive.  I think I&#8217;m a little biased.  The last one I
picked up for $35 (after $60 in rebates) and it was 200GB.  I don&#8217;t want to get
anything that&#8217;s a worse deal.  I saw that Hitachi just came out with 500GB SATA
drives.  Maybe this is the excuse I&#8217;ve needed to pick an SATA controller.</p>

<p>Of course, I might be able to skew this to say that I need a new MythTV box.
After all, I&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV</a> card in there
that can&#8217;t even be used because the computer is too slow (and I haven&#8217;t put up
an antenna yet).  Also, the system randomly gets overloaded and crashes.  If I
were to purchse a nice AMD Athlon 64x2 4800 that would never happen.  Of course,
I won&#8217;t be able to afford one of those until they&#8217;re in the $200 price range.
Silly house sucking up all of our money.  What do we need capital for?</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the last few years I&#8217;ve managed to rip quite a few of my CD&#8217;s to <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">OGG Vorbis</a> format.  While it&#8217;s partially a political statement, it&#8217;s more just a technological issue. OGG is better than MP3 and it&#8217;s easier for me to get going under Linux. Anyway, a few months ago <a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a> bought an iPod Mini, which sadly does not play OGG (note to self: email <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> about getting OGG support).</p>

<p>This leaves us in a conundrum as I don&#8217;t want to rerip all of my music, and Kristina would like to not have rip everything either.  I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/davyd/135047.html">Davyd Madeley&#8217;s OGG->MP3 script</a>.  This works just fine under linux (mad props to <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> folks).  But that still leaves us with the fact that MP3 is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=teh+suck">teh suck</a>.</p>

<p>A little hacking shows that there are AAC plugins for GStreamer (based on <a href="http://www.audiocoding.com/">libfaac</a>) and that they <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gst-plugins/0.8.8.html">should be able to create AAC files</a>.  Unfortunately, with GStreamer 0.8.8 this does not seem to be the case.  Which is sad, because I might actually consider converting my music to AAC, but that&#8217;s not going to happen now.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to do, provide an easy way for Kristina to load OGG files, transcoded of course, onto her iPod.  Ideally, it would be cool if this could be relatively transparent.  Here&#8217;s our setup to work with:</p>

<ul>
<li>music hosted on <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> Hoary</li>
<li>Client runs Windows XP Home edition</li>
<li>Relatively new iPod Mini</li>
</ul>


<p>Samba takes care of the file access.  Is there a way I can make a virtual sort of share that automatically transcodes music as it is accessed (similar to what <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> does with KIO Slaves?).  This would be the ideal situation.  If that&#8217;s not possible, is a way to have iTunes transcode from OGG when it gets ogg files?  If that&#8217;s not possible, anyone know of a simple desktop app that my wife could use to transcode between OGG and AAC or MP3?</p>

<p>Yeah, this is a lazyweb request.  I&#8217;ve done my share of searching on this problem.  I dislike how everything in the windows world is hidden behind a &#8220;pay me now&#8221; ideology.  ::sigh::  There is an <a href="http://qtcomponents.sourceforge.net/">OGG QuickTime component</a>, but I&#8217;ve heard mixed results on that.</p>

<p>ps: don&#8217;t even try and suggest <a href="http://www.ipodlinux.org/Main_Page">iPod Linux</a>.  I&#8217;m not going there with Kristina&#8217;s iPod.  Both her and I have something better to do.</p>
