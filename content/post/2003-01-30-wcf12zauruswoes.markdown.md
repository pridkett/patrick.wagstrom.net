Apparently I've got problems when using the WCF12 and the Zaurus.  At first I thought that it was just my problem, but another person seems to have the same problem.  After inserting the card, about 5 minutes later it will just magically stop working.  If we reinsert the card the network works again.  It seems to work fine in ad-hoc mode, and I can run Kismet for an indefinite period of time without any problems, but using IP with a WAP seems to cause some problems.  If anyone has some help, I would appreciate it.
