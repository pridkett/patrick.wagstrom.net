New Year's 2006 - Information Overload

<!-- Date: 2006-01-08 21:23 -->
<p>
Another issue that I've been dealing with is spending too much time reading
email and blogs, so I've decided to reduce those issues.  To that end, I'm
unsubscribing from a lot of mailing lists and putting lots of blogs on
their two weeks notice.  If I don't notice that they're gone for a few weeks,
they stay gone.

Combined with throwing all of my email from last year in a DMZ, I hope this
reduces the amount of time I need end up killing with useless email and
blogs.
