<p>
Either that or you're just curious about who I am.  Well, I'm not really looking for a job right now because I just started
work on Ph.D.  Maybe in the future when I'm closer to being done with my Ph.D. or when I need something to do on a lazy
Sunday afternoon I'll work on putting my resume back up.

This has a little higher priority than the resume.  I'll get this going when stuff calms down in a few weeks here.  Brief info goes something like this.
Graduated with High honors with three bachelor of science degrees from Illinois
Institute of Technology in May of 2002 (Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
Electrical Engineering).  Graduated with a master of science in Computer Science
degree from Illinois Institute of Technology in July of 2003.
