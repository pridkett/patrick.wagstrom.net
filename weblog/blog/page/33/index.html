  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve created a first rough go at an XSLT renderer for pyblosxom.  It&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s not horrible either.  I need to figure out how to get the flavor of the of
the request before entering the renderer.  I don&#8217;t want the XSLT renderer to be used except on certaint flavor requests, which causes problems becaues right now it is
being used on all flavor requests.  If you&#8217;re using an XSLT browser this makes no difference, but if you&#8217;re using a non-xslt browser I&#8217;d imagine that it would break
a lot of the files.  Oh well, not a major concern right now.  You can find the link to the plugin on my <a href="/weblog/projects/">projects page</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I realized that my first incarnation might have been a bit unrefined in some
respects.  This new version is much easier to run an XSLT parser over and
eliminates a lot of the redunancies.  Feel free to <a href="/weblog/projects/pyblosxom/plugins/xmlcalendar.py">fetch the new version</a>
from the same spot.  I also got an email from <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/">Wari Wahab</a> (the author
of pyBlosxom) today suggesting that I make some of my other changes with the
browser specific flavors as a renderer.  I&#8217;m going to look into that this
weekend.  If that works then I&#8217;ll probably just have some special code for
the HTML version of the page where it generates the XSLT then sends it through xsltproc serverside before
sending off to the older clients.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I officially created my first plugin for pyblosxom.  I wasn&#8217;t happy with the calendar plugin that shipped with
it, so I hacked it to ouptput straight XML.  Then the XML can be parsed in XSLT like the rest of the system.  This leads to
a greater amount of flexibility (althought at the moment, it&#8217;s just outputing the same old calendar).  Eventually I&#8217;m going to have to
hack it together so the XMLNS it uses is user configurable, but that shouldn&#8217;t be that hard.</p>

<p>You can find it at <a href="/weblog/projects/pyblosxom/plugins/xmlcalendar.py">/projects/pyblosxom/plugins/xmlcalendar.py</a>. To use it, just include the variable $xmlcalendar in your templates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so I&#8217;ve got an XML/XSLT version of my weblog that I&#8217;ve been working on.
I would like for the XML/XSLT version to be the default for browsers like
Mozilla and Firebird while retaining the HTML version for the rest of my
website.  However, Pyblosxom doesn&#8217;t allow this.  Until now!  There were a few
steps to this project that needed to be completed.  The first was stopping
Pyblosxom from escaping out > and &lt; when sending out content type of
&#8220;text/xml&#8221;.  That&#8217;s what this patch is for:</p>

<p>There are a few spots there where the patch could be tightened because I got
rid of some spaces, but oh well, too late now.  Now the final step is to add
the lines to your config.py file to support all of this.  Here is the lines
that I have to make the defaultFlavour &#8220;html&#8221; and have newer version of Mozilla
use &#8220;xml&#8221;.  Basically, this looks at the user agent of the browser, and if
&#8220;rv:1.4&#8221; or greater is found, the it returns the default as XML.</p>

<pre><code>py['defaultFlavour'] = 'html'
py['browserFlavour'] = [ ['rv:1.[4-9]','xml'] ]
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, right now this only works on the main page for the browser.  I&#8217;m
working on a way to have it change links and always spit out XML/XSLT.  When
that happens I&#8217;ll post it to this category too.  Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first entry that I&#8217;m doing with the new blogging system,
pyblosxom.  I&#8217;ve looked at a lot of systems, and for the past year I used <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> but it was probably a bit
more than I actually needed.  To make things worse it is written in Perl and I
HATE perl with a passion.</p>

<p>So when the time came to install a new server setup, I decided that <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom">pyblosxom</a> would make a
nice choice.  It&#8217;s simple, extensible, and it&#8217;s written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still ironing some various things with this.  Among them are the
mod_rewrite voodoo that I&#8217;m using to automagically redirect stuff around
without allowing my web directory to become too horribly messy again.  I&#8217;d
rather have my config file be messy than my web directory.</p>

There is more information over at <a href="http://www.cheesebikini.com/blog/archives/000261.html">cheesebikini</a>.</p>

<p>I think this is an interesting concept, but the person organizing seems to be rather put off that someone called the cops last time.  I&#8217;d be pissed off too.  It&#8217;s a perfectly safe gathering of people.  It&#8217;s probably going to be good business for the businesses involved because they see lots of people coming in and out.  And best of all, it&#8217;s meant to be safe.  Don&#8217;t cops have better things to do, like busting child molestors or thieves?  Oh well, welcome to Ashcroft&#8217;s America.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Memorial Day, CompUSA had a really good sale on WinTV PVR 250 hardware MPEG encoder cards.  I had been thinking about getting one for a while now, but they were too much on eBay.  Well, after using a few tricks, the final price will be $75 after rebate.  The card showed up on Thursday morning.  What follows is how I got it working.</p>

<h4>Major References</h4>

<p>This guide will tell you how to get the card running with MythTV and LIRC.  Here are some of the sites that will be very helpful to you on your quest.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://ivtv.sf.net/">ivtv.sf.net</a> - this is where the driver for the WinTV PVR 250 lives</p></li>

</ul>


<h4>Kernel Recompiling</h4>

<p>If you&#8217;re afraid of recompiling the kernel, abandon all hope and turn back now.  I&#8217;ve heard that if you have RedHat 9, that you&#8217;re in good shape as it already has Video4Linux2 installed.  If you&#8217;re using something else, like RedHat 7.3 (or gentoo, or debian&#8230;.), then you&#8217;re going to need to do this.</p>

<p>The first step is to go download the kernel sources from <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>.  You&#8217;ll need at least 2.4.20 for this to work.  The next thing you&#8217;ll need is the kernel patches for the new video for linux drivers.  You can find these at <a href="http://bytesex.org/patches">http://bytesex.org/patches</a>.  I recommend getting the all in one patch because you don&#8217;t need to worry about order then.  Now it&#8217;s time for some patching fun.  Apply the patch the the kernel.  This can be done by copying the patch to your <strong>/usr/src/linux</strong> after unpacking the new kernel.  Then you can patch your kernel using the following procedure (the output is for kernel 2.4.20 with <a href="http://bytesex.org/patches/2.4.20/patch-2.4.20-kraxel.gz">this patch</a>):</p>

You&#8217;ll need to make sure that <strong>CONFIG_I2C</strong>, <strong>CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT</strong>, <strong>CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV</strong> and <strong>CONFIG_VIDEO_PROC_FS</strong> are all set.  If you can do it as a module, that would probably be helpful.  I might have forgotten a few things here.  So don&#8217;t kill me.  I hate kernel compiling.</p>

<p>Wash, rinse, repeat until your shiny new kernel works.  There is plenty of stuff out there on how to install a kernel, so don&#8217;t ask me.  Go read <a href="http://www.tldp.org/">the docs</a>.</p>

<h4>Driver Compiling</h4>

<p>After you&#8217;ve managed to recompile your kernel you need to go and compile the drivers.  You can fetch the CVS drivers off <a href="http://ivtv.sf.net/">ivtv.sf.net</a>.  Follow the instructions posted in the FAQ about how to get it to work.  It is very important that you not miss the section about ripping the firmware from the CDROM.  Without the firmware the drivers will not work.</p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve made the drivers you need to add some lines to your <strong>/etc/modules.conf</strong> file to automatically load the appropriate modules.</p>

<pre><code># WinTV PVR 250
alias char-major-81 videodev
alias char-major-81-0 ivtv
options ivtv debug=1 mpg_buffers=32
options tuner type=2
options msp3400 once=1 simple=1
add below ivtv msp3400 saa7115 tuner
</code></pre>

<p>If you have another tuner card in your system that is /dev/video0, you will probably need to change the <strong>alias char-major-81-0 ivtv</strong> to the approriate reference to /dev/videoX (where X is the id of your ivtv card).  You can find this by running <strong>ivtv/utils/ivtvfwextract.pl &#8211;use-encoder-image=2</strong>.  You may need to change that value for encoder image, but that&#8217;s what worked for me.</p>

<h4>XMLTV Fun</h4>

<p>One of the major components that is needed for MythTV to function properly is XMLTV.  This is a perl module that you can pick up from <a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/</a>.  There are nice pacakges for Redhat 9 on there, but we&#8217;re not using RedHat 9, so we need to compile it from source.  There is a good chance that this will require some extra packages, this is where <strong>perl -MCPAN -e shell</strong> quickly becomes your friend.  As it complains about packages not being installed, install them.  You should be in good shape after this.</p>

<p>Lucky for you, this is going to lead up to how to install MythTV.  MythTV doesn&#8217;t require you do any complex setup for XMLTV, so don&#8217;t worry about setup for now.</p>

<h4>LIRC</h4>

<p>Now you&#8217;ll probably want to get that cool remote control of yours working.  This can be accomplished via the <strong>lirc_i2c</strong> module of lirc.  Just compile the module using the standard methods.  If for some reason the <strong>lirc_i2c</strong> module doesn&#8217;t work correctly, you should try running the command: <strong>./configure &#8211;with-driver=hauppauge</strong> to ensure it gets compiled.  Then you&#8217;ll want to install the drivers and make sure that everything is good in your <strong>/etc/modules.conf</strong>.  Make sure to add these lines:</p>

<pre><code># lirc stuff
alias char-major-61 lirc_i2c
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is to copy the configuration file to the <strong>/etc/lircd.conf</strong>.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about training your remote and making your own configuration file because the ivtv driver comes with a remote file for the remote.  In my case I have the gray remote, so I copied <strong>ivtv/utils/lircd-g.conf</strong> to <strong>/etc/lircd.conf</strong> and everything seemed to work fine.</p>

<p>The final step is probably the most annoying.  You still need to configure your remote control by creating your own <strong>~/.lircrc</strong> file.  I&#8217;m not going to list the entire contents of my file here.  But, you can download it <a href="/weblog/misc/dotlircrc">my .lircrc</a> file.  It is preconfigured for mplayer and irxevent, which is what MythTV uses.</p>

<h4>MythTV</h4>

<p>The last thing that you&#8217;ll want to do is install <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  Installing this will make your friends wish they were as cool as you and feel shame because they still run windows.  It really has the potential to be a &#8220;killer application&#8221; for Linux.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going into the details on how to get mythtv running.  There is lots of documentation on the mythtv website that I would suggest you read.  It&#8217;s not an easy program to install as it requires MySQL in addition to the stuff above, but you should really enjoy it.</p>

<h4>Random Helpful Tips</h4>

<p>If you just want to watch some live TV without installing MythTV, you can use the ghetto mplayer trick.  Using a command line like <strong>mplayer -vo xv /dev/video -cache 65536</strong> will provide live TV with a short buffer for pausing the screen.  In reality you need more than a 64 meg cache to really make it productive.</p>

<p>One thing that I&#8217;ve found really helpful is to have some aliases set up so I can do some easier manipulation of the card via the command line.  I&#8217;ve pased them here (for Bash), in hopes that they might help you:</p>

<pre><code>                alias test_ioctl='~patrick/ivtv/ivtv/utils/test_ioctl'
                alias tvsmall='test_ioctl -f width=400,height=300'
                alias tvmed='test_ioctl -f width=512,height=384'
                alias tvlarge='test_ioctl -f width=720,height=480'
                alias tvqmed='test_ioctl -c bitrate=4000000,bitrate_peak=10000000'
                alias tvqhigh='test_ioctl -c bitrate=8000000,bitrate_peak=16000000'
                alias tvqlow='test_ioctl -c bitrate=2500000,bitrate_peak=5000000'
                alias ptune='/home/patrick/ivtv/ivtv/utils/ptune.pl --channel'
                alias noghost='test_ioctl --set-codec-params=dnr_mode=0,dnr_temporal=0'
</code></pre>

<p>The first three (<strong>tvsmall</strong>, <strong>tvmed</strong>, <strong>tvlarge</strong>) set the resolution that the card captures video at.  The next three (<strong>tvqhigh</strong>, <strong>tvqmed</strong>, <strong>tvqlow</strong>) set the quality taht the bit stream is recorded at.  <strong>ptune</strong> is a simple alias so you can change the channel.  Finally, <strong>noghost</strong> can be used if your card is getting weird ghosts that wouldn&#8217;t be there on a normal TV.</p>

<p>As a side note, when I first started, I almost used <a href="http://freevo.sf.net/">freevo</a> instead of MythTV because I could get it to work better and faster.  I gave MythTV one last shot before I was to kill it, and was able to make it sing.  There are a few tricks you should know.  First of all, running the UI for MythTV at a resolution other than 800x600 will incur a performance penalty as everything has to be scaled.  There are options in the program to force it to run at a certain resolution, use them.  Secondly, if you have a slower computer, turn off deinterlacing.  This is covered in the FAQ for mythtv, but reading the mailing list indicates that a lot of people miss this entirely.  Lastly, if it is really slow on playback, lower the video quality to a lower resolution.  The default is full frame maximum quality, which while fine for an Athlon XP 3200+, doesn&#8217;t cut it on my Athlon 700.</p>
