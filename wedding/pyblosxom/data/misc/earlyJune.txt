So, I haven't been as diligent in updating this as I should have been.  Here
is a quick rundown of what's been going on from my point of view.  I now have
a best man, which is good, because for a long time I wasn't sure who it was
going to be.  All of the attendants for the wedding have been selected.
Invites have been mailed.  Kristina is having her second shower tomorrow, the
first one was in Minnesota a few weeks ago.  And lots of other stuff that
I didn't mention because I forgot.

I'm flying down to Texas next Wednesday to take care of last minute stuff like
getting a marriage license, meeting with the pastor, and that sort of stuff.
It's a pretty quick trip, just 4 days or so.  Then it's back here for a few
weeks until Kristina flies up here and we drive down to Texas together the
week before the wedding.

As of this writing, my wedding is in 34 days, 21 hours and 51 minutes.  This
is courtesy of a little countdown timer that Becky Bogolub decided to put
on my phone at the end of April.  Also, I supposedly have a 1 hour alarm
warning before the wedding just in case I forgot, also set by Becky.
