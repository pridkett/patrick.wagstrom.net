It's more than a little ironic that the [MPAA](http://www.mpaa.org/) said that the broadcast flag was about "[Keeping Honest People Honest](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000306.html)".  Felton makes a good point about the whole definition of honesty.  It's even more interesting when on considers some of the things that the MPAA has done and said in the past.  Hardly a group of people who I would call honest.
