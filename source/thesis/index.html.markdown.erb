Mockus (Avaya research), and M. Granger Morgan (EPP at CMU).

Master of Science Thesis
------------------------

Department of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology.
My committee was Xian-He Sun and Gady Agam.  Despite the very large
number of Master of Science degrees that IIT awards in computer
science, very few students write a thesis.

My thesis defense took place on July 16, 2003.
