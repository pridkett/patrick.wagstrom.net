That's right!  Just when I thought it would never get published a book shows up
for me today in the office.  Right there in chapter 5 is what I wrote.  It's a
little strange because it has three different affiliations listed for me,
Argonne National Lab, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Carnegie Mellon
Univeristy.  Anyway, go [buy a
copy](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471332887.html) or
just ask to borrow mine.
