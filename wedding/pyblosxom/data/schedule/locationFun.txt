Location Fun!

<p>
Everybody say it with me "planning a wedding is fun".  We came up with what we
thought was this wonderful idea for what we wanted to do.  We thought it was a
great plan.  Here is what we wanted to do.  Have a short wedding around 2pm or
so, lasting until a little before 3pm.  Then a little cake reception in the
church afterwards.  Then later around 5 or 6pm we'd have a less formal
barbeque.  Anyway, there were lots of issues with timing and it generally being a ton
of stuff to plan.  So, after consultation with Kristina's mom, our plan of the last 24 hours was scratched.

Now it's looking like we're going to a bit more traditional of a wedding and reception thing.  This will be shorter
(which is good) and easier to plan.  The place we're hoping for is <a

Recreation Center</a> in Old Settler's Park right next to the church.  This
means no long commutes to the reception site.  But we need to see if it's
available.  If that works out we'll probably have a wedding later in the day, around 4 or 5pm and have the reception right after the pictures.

Neither one of us is big on doing a dance thing at the reception, partially out
of cheapness and partially because we're not big on that sort of stuff (and
it's our wedding).  If you have an idea about what else we can do to at the
reception to keep people entertained during the reception let us know.
