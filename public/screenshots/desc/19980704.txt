Just a little something I did to show how I modified my .Xdefaults to make <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> look a little cooler.  The thing at the bottom is an xripple session running.  The window manager in this one is <A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org">WindowMaker 0.16</A>.  Also running is a session of <A HREF="http://www.bitchx.com/">BitchX</A>.  Oh yeah, and RXVT's with background pixmaps too.
