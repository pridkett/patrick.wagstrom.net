Once again I got distracted, imagine that.  So you might know that I've
been interested in a lot of the things that the [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/) has to offer.  In particular is the use of MetaData,
such as [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/), to describe documents.  This
is actually a key part of what I plan on doing in [PennAve](http://pennave.sourceforge.net/).






Along those lines, somehow last night I got distracted by [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/), so I decided to update [my foaf
file](/foaf.rdf) with the relevant information about me.  I also went a step further
and figured out how to [sign](http://usefulinc.com/foaf/signingFoafFiles) my FOAF file.  If I ever get really interested, I'll make some more
personal information available in a special [encrypted FOAF file](http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles).  But this if fine for now.






I put a little icon on the side of the page advertising how neato FOAF can
be.  Right now it's a GIF, I don't really like that.  They had some smaller
ones that I'll look into also.  Also, there was a nifty SVG one that someone
had, but that will just show up as weird for most people.  But, then again,
I'd like to think people interested in the sematic web also have support
for [SVG](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) in their browsers.
