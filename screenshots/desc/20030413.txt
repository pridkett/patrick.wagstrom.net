I got sick of blue over the weekend.  So I first switched my iconset to the most
excellent Noia-warm iconset.  I also darkened my colors a bit too.  I'm using
Keramik for my KDE theme and Geramik for my GTK theme here.  I think I'll leave
my emacs colors as it for a while as they seem to work really well.
