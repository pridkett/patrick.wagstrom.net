Google Adsense XSLT Trickery

Recently I've been getting lots of hits for my <a href="/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml">MythTV on Ubuntu Athlon64</a> writeup.  I'm talking several hundred a
day.  This generates a decent amount of traffic over my little cable modem line.
Realizing that I now had a product people wanted, I was off to try and
"monetize" that.  Where do I go?  But to Google Adsense!
</p>
<p>
Google Adsense is frighteningly easy to get working.  I was serving ads
literally five minutes after I signed up.  This includes the time it took for
my account to be validated by replying to an email.  However, it has a little bit of a drawback, the
ads are inserted dynamically using a special little bit of javascript.  This
posed a couple of problems for me on a site where most of my pages are
generated using XSLT: 1. how to get the javascript in the XSLT.  2. How to
get the javascript to execute.
</p>
<p>
I tried lots of fun stuff to get the adsense to properly show up in the
on the fly XSLT translations, but was at a standstill.  If I had the server
run everything through xsltproc before sending it to the client, it would work
fine but that was slow and not nearly as cool as having the browser do the XSLT
translation. For some reason, however, it looked like Firefox and XSLT capable browsers 
would begin executing parts of the code before the page was fully transformed.
My first inclination was to use the onload hook in the body of the generated
web page to get around this limitation.  In theory this does not get called until everything is completely
rendered.  While I was able to get an onload function to be called, it was not
capable of inserting the code into the div I had allocated.  The reason for
this that when you use the innerHTML property of an element to set it's
HTML, it doesn't execute the script.  This means I had no way to tell the
script to go and activate itself.  Crap.
</p>
<p>
So I was stuck, I couldn't just put it right in the document because it would
start executing before the page was created, causing it to not execute and I
couldn't create it dynamically.  The solution?  Our hideous friend the iframe.
Using an iframe with the width and height exactly that of google adsense block
and setting it to no border, no padding, and no margin, I was able to load
a little block after the page was translated and put up ads.  Best of all,
because iframes are transparent, the original page's referer header is sent
on all subsuquent requests.  And voila, it seems to work.  It's not optimal,
but it's how I managed to get around that nasty problem.  Hope this can help
you in the future.
