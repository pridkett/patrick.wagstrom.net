Yeah, so knowing my luck no one will get a chance to read this.  I'm going out of town for
a week or so.  With any luck I won't have internet access while I'm gone.  This means that
scissors will be on autopilot.  This also means that it will probably crash 10 minutes after
I leave for the airport.

If you're interested in where I'm going, I'm presenting some of my research at
[OSS 2005](http://oss2005.case.unibz.it/) in Genoa, Italy.  [Kristina](http://kristina.wagstrom.net/)
is staying behind, so it's not like I've got a romantic first anniversary on the
Italian Riviera planned.  Oh well, I'll make it up to her when I get back on the 16th.
