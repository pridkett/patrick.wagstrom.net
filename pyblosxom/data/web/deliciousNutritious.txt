del.icio.us and nutr.itio.us

<p>
In addition to <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, there is also
a nifty site called <a href="http://nutr.itio.us/">nutr.itio.us</a> that
automagically manages all of your tag names and gives suggestions for tags that
other people have used when visiting a site.  Furthermore, links are colored
by their relative popularity for that site.  Pretty damn cool.

Also there is a very cool <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">Delicious</a>
extension for <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>.  You can see it in
action below.  This makes it so much easier to manage my bookmarks than the
crappy hierarchical thing that I had been doing.  Yay for good software.
