This is an actual screenshot.  I took this on pimp, a 1998 Wallstreet Powerbook.
You can see MacOnLinux running.  I'm still tweaking that some, but it runs
all of the mac stuff at normal speed.  Also running is Heroes of Might and Magic
3 (the LinuxPPC version).  That laptop also has Myth2 and Civ:CTP installed.
Overall, it's a sweet setup.  The best laptop brand with one of the best OSes.
