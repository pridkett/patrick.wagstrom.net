Instead of doing homework I decided that I would rather finally add the feature
to my web pages where it shows my recent weblogs.  You should be able to see it
on the side of some of the pages.  This was accomplished using a modified
version of [RSSLIB](http://www.kludgebox.com/rsslib/) and some of my mad PHP
skills.
