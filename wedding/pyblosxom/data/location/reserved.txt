Church and Reception Hall Reserved

<p>
This morning, my mom paid for and officially reserved the church and a
reception room at the church so therefore the time will be July 10, 2004 at
4:00 PM at Palm Valley Lutheran Church in Round Rock, TX with the reception
shortly after (It's nice to have that set).  My mom is now looking into caterers
but that is nowhere near decided yet.
