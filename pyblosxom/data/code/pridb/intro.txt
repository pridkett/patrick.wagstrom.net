XML Based Database Program

I've started to work on a native XML database program that I can use as a backend for my weblog.  It's not
that I dislike PyBlosxom, it's just not groovy enough for me and the simplicity is perhaps a bit too
much for me.  I would like some more features and I saw some of the nifty stuff that <a href="http://www.syncato.org/">Syncato</a>
can do.  Unfortunately, I'm not too keen on getting XMLDB installed.  So I might as well write my own that allows
for XPATH queries and what not.

So last night and today I started work on PriDB.  It basically loads a set of XML documents and allows you to perform XPATH queries
on them.  The nice thing is that it's a little like a real database, in that it's client/server.  It's also easily embedable in other
Python programs.  The client/server thing is nice because it means that I don't have to parse the XML over and over.  Which is a
great savings when your webserver is only a 200MHz K6 that was your desktop machine when you first started college in 1997.
