Apparently some of my original emails to Cesar, the author of [MCatalog](https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/) got lost in transit, or his replies did, or something.  Anyway, after my requests, Cesar asked if I would like to maintain MCatalog, I agreed to the task.  So that will make my branch of MCatalog more or less the official trunk of MCatalog.

I wish I could say something like "To celebrate the momentus occassion, I present to you MCatalog 0.3," but I can't.  I had a few [issues marked for 0.3](https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/milestone/0.3), but when they were all resolved it didn't feelÂ  like a new release.  At least, not a jump from 0.2 to 0.3, maybe a 0.2.1 release or something.  So, I went and added more stuff to my todo list of 0.3.  Anyway, look for a release in the next few weeks.  Also, please download it, try it out, and give it some love.  It compiles pretty easily once you've added the mono-dev package in [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) Dapper.
