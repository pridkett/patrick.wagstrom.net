  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/pwags">Phil</a> sent me
an email about <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystem&#8217;s</a> new
<a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/">T2000</a> series
of servers, based on their Niagara core.  Basically, this is a 4, 6, or 8
core system, each of which can execute up to four threads in parallel.  It&#8217;s
supposed to be great for highly threaded, low FPU applications &#8211; like
web serving and database serving.</p>

<p>As part of their promotion, they&#8217;re doing this cool <a href="https://www.sun.com/emrkt/trycoolthreads/index.html">Try before you Buy</a> thing.  Basically,
you given them your information, they send you a server free for 60 days &#8211; they
even cover postage.  You evaluate it, if you like it, you pay for it.  If it
doesn&#8217;t work well for your field, send it back &#8211; once again, on Sun&#8217;s dime.  Pretty cool stuff.  What&#8217;s cooler, is that according to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?entry=niagara_benchmarks">Jonathan Schwartz</a>, they&#8217;re looking for people to benchmark these guys.  Specifically, if you
do a good enough job on the writeup, they may let you keep it.</p>

<p>So, being the graduate student I am, I immediately realized a couple of
different applications that I&#8217;d like to work on with this little guy.  Firstly,
we&#8217;re going to see how well he works as a spyware monitoring box &#8211; run multiple
instances of snort on him and a database to log everything to.  Should be
kinda interesting to see.  Secondly, I&#8217;m going to try and use it for some of
my network analysis stuff.  Specifically, seeing if it&#8217;s faster to run ORA on
it, or at the very least what&#8217;s the overall throughput.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little skeptical about it&#8217;s performance on some of the measures in ORA
because the cores share an FPU.  However, the integer measures should run quite
nicely.  I&#8217;ll also put it through the mixer by running Automap on a large amount
of text obtained from some of my open source reserach to evaluate how it&#8217;s able
to build a network based on all that data.</p>

<p>So if folks from <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> are reading this, please
let me get the machine.  I&#8217;ve got real research to be doing here, and I&#8217;m even
willing put down that I got cool hardware from Sun in my papers.  It&#8217;ll be even
cooler if you let me keep the box.  Here&#8217;s hoping for some interesting results
once it ships!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last year I wrote about some of the work that <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~seth/">Seth Nickell</a> was showing off regarding Luminocity, a GL acclerated fun
fest of X.  Well, times are moving along, and now it appears we&#8217;ve got a spat
on our hands between
<a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/">Xgl from Novell</a>, and
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RenderingProject/aiglx">AIGLX from Fedora/RedHat</a>.
The gist is that Fedora/RedHat thinks that Novell didn&#8217;t do it in enough of a community fashion and has taken to bashing Xgl with
claims like &#8220;it&#8217;s too revolutionary&#8221; and the like.  Someone should tell RedHat
that it just makes them look like asses doing that sort of stuff.  Seriously,
Novell beat you out with XGL, they&#8217;re functionally different anyway.  XGL is
an entirely GL based X-server, AIGLX renders stuff in GL off screen.  From what
I can tell, XGL is much closer to the future of the desktop.</p>

<p>With that in mind, <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/~davidr/xgl-demo1.xvid.avi">David Reveman of Novell put out an mindboggling demo</a>.  It&#8217;s 58 megs of
xvid goodness, but shows some seriously cool stuff.  There&#8217;s more videos of
the demo at the <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/">Xgl page at
Novell</a>.  Likewise, there are also some nifty <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/RenderingProject/aiglx">AIGLX videos</a>.  But I don&#8217;t see a semi
transparent Quake 3 running on the corner of a cube metaphor desktop in the latter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been getting lots of hits for my <a href="/weblog/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml">MythTV on Ubuntu Athlon64</a> writeup.  I&#8217;m talking several hundred a day.  This generates a decent amount of traffic over my little cable modem line. Realizing that I now had a product people wanted, I was off to try and &#8220;monetize&#8221; that.  Where do I go?  But to Google Adsense!</p>

<p>Google Adsense is frighteningly easy to get working.  I was serving ads literally five minutes after I signed up.  This includes the time it took for my account to be validated by replying to an email.  However, it has a little bit of a drawback, the ads are inserted dynamically using a special little bit of javascript.  This posed a couple of problems for me on a site where most of my pages are generated using XSLT: 1. how to get the javascript in the XSLT.  2. How to get the javascript to execute.</p>

<p>I tried lots of fun stuff to get the adsense to properly show up in the on the fly XSLT translations, but was at a standstill.  If I had the server run everything through xsltproc before sending it to the client, it would work fine but that was slow and not nearly as cool as having the browser do the XSLT translation. For some reason, however, it looked like Firefox and XSLT capable browsers would begin executing parts of the code before the page was fully transformed. My first inclination was to use the onload hook in the body of the generated web page to get around this limitation.  In theory this does not get called until everything is completely rendered.  While I was able to get an onload function to be called, it was not capable of inserting the code into the div I had allocated.  The reason for this that when you use the innerHTML property of an element to set it&#8217;s HTML, it doesn&#8217;t execute the script.  This means I had no way to tell the script to go and activate itself.  Crap.</p>

<p>So I was stuck, I couldn&#8217;t just put it right in the document because it would start executing before the page was created, causing it to not execute and I couldn&#8217;t create it dynamically.  The solution?  Our hideous friend the iframe. Using an iframe with the width and height exactly that of google adsense block and setting it to no border, no padding, and no margin, I was able to load a little block after the page was translated and put up ads.  Best of all, because iframes are transparent, the original page&#8217;s referer header is sent on all subsuquent requests.  And voila, it seems to work.  It&#8217;s not optimal, but it&#8217;s how I managed to get around that nasty problem.  Hope this can help you in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a prime example of what happens when programmers write error messages:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2006/01/uselessErrorMessages.png"></p>

<p>This is an error that was repeated several times for different files when I was copying over some newly ripped CDs from my laptop to my MythTV box. Unfortunately, there are several things wrong with this error dialog that make it useless:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can&#8217;t see the complete filename, nor can I expand the box to make the complete filename visible.  In this case I could make out where it was having problems, but if I had a common naming structure for files across many directories, I would not be able to tell where it was having problems.</li>
<li>&#8220;Access Denied&#8221; is a very vague term.  Is it access denied on the source or the destination?  Other one of which can cause such a problem.  In this case the problem was a lack of write permissions for the destination directory on the server, but it does not make it clear that if its a problem with reading the file or writing the file.</li>
<li>Lastly, it does not make a distinction if this is a file or a directory that it&#8217;s having problems with.  In this case it was a directory, but given how
Windows and Mac folks are lazy about file extensions, that may not always be so obvious.</li>
</ol>


<p>It&#8217;s funny, it seems like an error dialog is such a simple little thing, but making one not work correctly can be big problems.  Chalk this up to another &#8220;it&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be so difficult&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re running MythTV on an Athlon 64 platform, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that the CPU throttles itself down when transcoding and cutting commercials despite the fact that your processor may show as being 100% utilized.  This results in much slower transcoding than one would normally expect, but saves a small amount of power.</p>

<p>However, if you record a lot of stuff, or even a moderate amount of stuff in HD, this property and increased delay can be quite annoying.  It can take several extra hours to cut and transcode an hour long HDTV program when running at 1.2GHz instead of 2.4GHz (my analysis shows a greater then 2.5x slowdown - which is weird in itself).  First, let&#8217;s cover the reason you system slow down, and then we&#8217;ll cover what to do about it.</p>

<p>Processors take a lot of power - most of that power is dissipated as heat because of the resistance in the CPU.  Slowly, <a href="http://www.amd.com/">AMD</a> and <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a> are realizing that people don&#8217;t want extra heaters in their living room/office, that powering all of these computers puts a real dent in your wallet, and that most of the energy is wasted because the processor is idle anyway.  The solution?  Create not only more effecient processors, but also allow processors that throttle back to conserve power when they&#8217;re not being fully utilized.  On the Athlon 64 platform this is called &#8221;<a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/ProductInformation/0,,30_118_9485_9487%5E10272,00.html">Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet</a>&#8221; and has been available since the Winchester core chips.</p>

<p>Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet works with a couple of different parts: a Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet enabled processor, a Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet enabled motherboard, and a software program that manages it all.  If you&#8217;re running a socket 939 Athlon 64, you&#8217;ve almost certainly got the first two.  Under Linux, you can directly control the CPU power state through the proc file system, or you can have a daemon process, such as powernowd, manage it for you.  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> installs powernowd automatically and starts it for you, so out of the box you&#8217;re getting some of the benefits of this technology.</p>

<p>However, powernowd is configured to not take into account nice processes.  Normally, this is fine, nice processes can afford to run a bit slower, that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re nice in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is only set up to consider nice processes as a group and can&#8217;t differentiate between a process that can&#8217;t take advantage of increase speed and one that can, such as transcoding.  And, as you&#8217;ve probably guessed by now, to minimize interference with other programs, <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> runs transcoding and commercial flagging processes as nice. To speed them up all we need to do is tell powernowd to take into account nice processes.</p>

<p>In Ubuntu, this is really straight forward.  Most startup scripts for daemons look in the /etc/default directory for local configuration overrides.  By default powernow is run with only the -q flag, telling it to be quiet. If we also pass the -n flag, it will take nice processes into account when deciding whether or not to throttle the processor. The solution, create a file /etc/default/powernowd with a single line in it:</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS="-q -n"
</code></pre>

<p>Then issue the command /etc/init.d/powernowd restart and your computer will no longer throttle itself when transcoding and commercial flagging.  Enjoy the increased speed of transcoding and happy MythTVing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Welcome to my first entry of the 2006 fiscal blogging year (which mere mortals
know as the 2006 calendar year).  If you&#8217;re an astute reader, you may remember
that I did a similar entry to this <a href="/weblog/weblog/2004/01/newYear2004">two years ago</a>.  In that entry I lamented about being fat and not finishing the
bible.  Fast forward to 2006, I still haven&#8217;t finished the bible, but I&#8217;m not
as fat, although I need to loose the excess weight I&#8217;ve gained over the
last few weeks in Texas and Minnesota.</p>

<p>Also, you may recall that I said that I don&#8217;t usually make new year&#8217;s
resolutions.  Well, a lot of stuff can <a href="/weblog/photos/wedding">change in two years</a> that cause you to rethink that.  That means that this
year I&#8217;ve decided to do some new years resolutions.  As I formulate them
better I&#8217;ll post them in this blog.  Here&#8217;s my first one:</p>

<p><strong>Eliminate high fructose corn syrup from my diet</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup">High Fructose Corn Syrup</a> (HFCS) is the incredibly popular sweetener found in just about everything.
From Coca-Cola, to Smucker&#8217;s Jam, to Frosted Mini-Wheats.  If it tastes good
and is sweet, there is probably high fructose corn syrup in there.  There are
some good aspects of the sweetener, it provides additional income for farmers
and reduces reliance on foreign sources of sweeteners.  It&#8217;s also good
virtually forever, which is why so many sweets last forever.  More information
can be found on <a href="http://www.hfcsfacts.com/">HFCSFacts.com - a project
of the corn refiners association</a>.  This page makes HFCS look like pretty
good stuff, and it might be.</p>

<p>But you had better beware.  Because even though HFCS is found everywhere,
there are questions about the actual ramifications of HFCS.  A few weeks ago,
<a href="http://www.sprol.com/?p=236">Sprol did a nice writeup of the possible
dangers of HFCS</a>, however, like many Sprol items, it&#8217;s a little speculative.
Fortunately, I&#8217;ve found some other articles from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A8003-2003Mar10?language=printer">The Washington Post</a>,
and <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2002658491_healthsyrup04.html">The Seattle Times</a> indicating that HFCS might be highly related
to the increase in obesity in the United States.  Personally, I think that
American&#8217;s are just lazy.</p>

<p>Well, in any case, I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to try and eliminate it.  This
means no regular pop, no regular jelly, no frosted mini wheats.  I also will
be staying away from diet colas because I find they cause joint problems.  I&#8217;ll
post an update in a few weeks on my progress here.</p>

<p>As a full disclaimer, I&#8217;m not eliminating HFCS immediately.  Any products with
HFCS laying around the house will be eaten rather than thrown away.  I&#8217;ll try
to make sure new products have no HFCS.  I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;ll do when I need
a product with HFCS - we&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we reach it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After trying a new motherboard and all that jazz to get my HDTV tuner card working
properly I decided to try a new operating system.  The thing that prompted this was
the notice that some people thought it might be a buffer related issue that was
causing some of the reception problems with the card.  I also noticed that my system
was consistently above 2000 context switches a second even when idle.  There was
usually around 1100 interrupts a second.  I compared this to my RHEL AS box which
was around 30/s when idle and running a lot more stuff.</p>

<p>So, today I set out to test this theory some.  I dropped in a FC4 x86_64 dvd and
installed it on a blank partition on my hard disk.  Sure enough, preliminary tests
indicate that I&#8217;m not loosing data and reception remains clear even when I&#8217;m under
heavy IO load, such as copying a file over.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my theory.  Ubuntu uses a kernel that switches tasks more often to create
a more interactive computing experience.  However, for devices that produce large
amounts of streaming bandwidth, such as HDTV tuner cards (and to a lesser degree
SDTV tuner cards), the tasks switch too fast and the buffers never can be completely
emptied.  By switching to a higher minimum time slice the processor has enough time
to empty out the buffers.</p>

<p>Now, the question is this: is there a simple way to change the minimum time slice
for tasks under Ubuntu?  I remember seeing something where I could set the timer at
10, 100, or 1000 and seeing that it was set to 1000, but I can&#8217;t find it in the
kernel configuration anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;re having HDTV reception problems, I strongly suggest looking at this
as an issue.  I&#8217;m not 100% certain, but the preliminary tests are good.  Unfortunately,
I can&#8217;t do the full battery yet because I don&#8217;t have time and I don&#8217;t even have
video working on MythTV box under Fedora.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the cold war many &#8220;citizens&#8221; of totalitarian states were required to
carry identification papers and show them on demand to authorities.  This
action was oestensibly done to check for criminals, but in reality the rulers
of these nations had something more insidious in mind.  They accurately released
that making the citizenry live in fear of the police was a wonderful way to
keep everyone under control.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2005 and America is heading in the same direction.  In September
<a href="http://www.papersplease.org/davis/">Deboarah Davis</a> was riding
the bus to work in Denver.  A police officer came on the bus, asked for
everyone&#8217;s ID on the bus, and had Mrs. Davis, a 50 yr old middle class mother
of three, thrown in jail on federal charges.  This is not my America, and this
insanity has to stop now.   Make a call to your reps and senators today and
tell them that you&#8217;re concerned about how America&#8217;s freedom is becoming a
permission society where the government dictates what route we can take to work,
what planes we can fly, and what trains we can ride.  What next?  What roads
we&#8217;re allowed to drive on?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After much frustration I&#8217;ve decided that no matter how many bells and whistles the <a href="http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=637">MSI K8N-Neo4 Platinum</a> has, it still can&#8217;t make up for the fact that I get some crazy bad electormagnetic interference when the system is under heavy load.  At first I thought it was just going to be on the pcHDTV HD-3000 card, but today during the Steelers game, while I was watching the game while it was recording and had commercial flagging running and the MPEG file just started to crap out.  Then blammo, MythTV died.  This is really annoying.  It doesn&#8217;t appear to actually mess up data on the bus, just the ability of the tuners to pull in channels using internal tuners.</p>

<p>After three weeks of fighting, vengeance will be mine.  I&#8217;m returning the board and getting a new <a href="http://www.asrock.com.tw/product/product_939Dual-SATA2.htm">ASRock 939Dual-SATA2</a> board instead.  This requires me to pick up a firewire card too and means that all the slots will be filled up from the get go.  But whatever, we&#8217;ll see how this works.  I may have to do another return if that doesn&#8217;t work well.</p>
