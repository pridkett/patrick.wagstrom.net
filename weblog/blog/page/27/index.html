Apache XSLT handler.  Behold <a href="http://www.mod-xslt2.com/">mod-xslt2</a>.
It seems like it does everything I want it to do.  Including using the

XSLT sheets.  Could be a nice combination with <a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">PennAve</a>, of course, it&#8217;s not difficult to put the translation in PennAve

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got ambitious yesterday and decided to upgrade the firmware on my WRT54G wireless router.  While there are a lot of choices, including <a href="http://www.portless.net/ewrt/">EWRT</a>, <a href="http://openwrt.ksilebo.net/">OpenWRT</a>, I decided to use the semi-open <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/">Sveasoft</a> firmware.  We&#8217;ll it is open, at least the release that I used, which is the slightly older Samadhi release.  So, after first using the Ping.asp exploit to turn boot_wait on, I then uploaded the firmware.  It seemd as though everything went okay, the router continued to function and give out IP addresses.  However, there was a big hitch, I couldn&#8217;t get to the internet from my computers behind it.  It turns out I had to reset the configuration of the device.  After this everything worked like a charm.  I&#8217;ve got SSH running on the box and it now hands out static IP addresses via DHCP, these addresses also get a hostname too.  I haven&#8217;t gotten around to mucking with WonderShaper yet because most of the time I don&#8217;t come close to fully utilizing my bandwidth.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve given some thought to running it as an open access point for everyone, but this would mean removing my WEP encryption (yes, it&#8217;s a joke for a good hacker, I know), which is not going to happen any time soon.  I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the ability to have the box grab an IPv6 address and do all that fun stuff.  Which would be very cool.  For right now, I&#8217;ll have to settle with leaving a few ports open to get behind the firewall to my server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve got a bit of a live demo of the gallery software running at <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/</a>.
Right now it mainly goes to show one thing, my web server is VERY VERY slow.
If you hit a page that hasn&#8217;t been hit before, it will be very slow as there
is the need to have the script resize the image.  Considering this server is
the computer that I had when I first went to college back in 1997, that can
take a while for large photos, like the digital camera shots.  Luckily, it
caches the photos for faster access later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went and registered the gallery software over at source forge, and
with that I also named the software, it&#8217;s going to be called PennAve, which
is a street by my house.  I figure that is better than pyDynaPhotoXMLGallery
or whatever other stupid name most people give to projects.  I&#8217;m working
on getting it installed on this server and will post a link to the demo when
it&#8217;s ready.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m in the process of cleaning up my gallery software for an initial
release and posting to <a href="http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>.
Mainly this consists of moving stuff into different files, and putting
credits on the files.  However, this has introduced the need to watch
how I was implementing some things as the original proof of concept was
nothing more than one 500 line python script.  This meant that everything
was in the same namespace, which shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>In any case, with the holiday weekend, I&#8217;ll probably have a bit of time
to set up the project over at SourceForge and then I&#8217;ll post more details
about it over there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently there has been a bit of a furor over the forthcoming book from the <a href="http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/">Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</a> (<a href="http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/">AdTI</a>) that touts how Linus did not really write the kernel.  I haven&#8217;t have a chance to read the book yet, but would like to.  The gist that I&#8217;ve seen, from sources like <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/">Andrew Tennenbaum</a> (author of Minix) and <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040523172344599">GrokLaw</a> is that it&#8217;s pretty poorly written trash.  I agree with Martin Pool when he says that if <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,52973,00.html">Microsoft paid for this report</a> they didn&#8217;t get much for their money.</p>

<p>Anyway, the writeup on <a href="http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/">Martin Pool&#8217;s page</a> does a good job of dissecting the book for all to enjoy.  I&#8217;m sure that Microsoft will trumpet this trash, so it&#8217;s important that everyone be informed.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2004-05-26T00:23:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">May 26<span>th</span>, 2004</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is just a quick update on my gallery software.  It&#8217;s coming along quite nicely, to be honest,
I think that it&#8217;s going better than I expected.  Who knows, I might actually finish this.  Or not.
Anyway, the system now spits out an XML file that is translated through an XSLT script.  The XML
file is really just an RDF file that contains all of the fun information about the creator, rights,
etc.  In addition, it also contains information about defined regions in the image.  These defined
regions can have annotations, just like with <a href="http://fotonotes.net/">fotonotes</a>.  I
haven&#8217;t yet added the ability to allow people to create regions, but that is coming soon enough.</p>

<p>I think the next big question is whether to do the system with a database backend or a file based
backend.  I already have a database set up, so I&#8217;m leaning in that direction, although that would
mean yet another dependency that would keep people from ever actually using the software.  I&#8217;m not
sure what I think about that.  XML files for storing the information, on the other hand, make it easy
to install (just like <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">gallery</a>) and move to a new system.  In
general, average users tend to stay away from databases, and for good reason.</p>

<p>Thus I am at an impasse.  Either make the system REALLY powerful by using a database backend, or
make it so anyone can use the system by using a flat file backend.  Or, I can spend 10 times the
amount of time and design an architecture that lets me use both.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, caching of images is now done, but it doesn&#8217;t check timestamps yet.   The whole timestamp
checking thing shouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal.  Adding in the image caching sped things up a whole
lot, but it also leaves dozens of files sitting around my /tmp directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kristina and I just bought a digital camera.  It&#8217;s not a wonderful one, but
it&#8217;s a pretty nice Canon PowerShot A75.  Good enough resolution, takes the
ubiquitous AA batteries and stores the photos on Compact Flash cards, which
are nice and cheap.  However, there is a problem.  We&#8217;d like to put up a
photo gallery, but most everyone uses <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">Gallery</a>, which I&#8217;m not too huge of a fan of.  So I&#8217;ve started to hack together my
own in Python (of course) using PIL for some of the manipulations.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t made a lot of the decisions yet, like whether or not to make it use
a database backend, but I have mad some design decisions and gotten it going
to a small extent.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The urls should contain most of the information rather than having it on
the hook.  This is a lot like the way that PyBloxsom works.  This means that
for a thumbnail of an image we use galley.py/thumbnail/IMG_0004.JPG instead of
gallery.py?img=IMG_0004.JPG&amp;op=thumbnail.</p></li>
<li><p>Wherever possible, it should be possible to annotate the images.  I really
like the way that <a href="http://w3photo.org/">w3photo</a> uses <a href="http://fotonotes.net/">fotonotes</a> to anootate the photos.  I&#8217;m gonna implement
something like this.</p></li>
<li><p>As much formatting as possible should be done outside the CGI script.  This
probably means that once again it&#8217;s gonna spit out XML which will be translated
using XSLT.</p></li>
<li><p>On the fly resizing is a must.  This is already done with the thumbnails,
but it should be available for other sizes too, as not everyone (or anyone basically) can view a 3 megapixel image on a screen, especially me with my 1.4 megapixel laptop screen.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;d like to make the software modular as possible and make it possible for
other people to use the software.  This means that I don&#8217;t want to have many
dependencies outside of Python, PIL, and LibXML for Python.  This should also
help ensure it still runs on Win32.</p></li>
<li><p>I need to create a solid standard for path naming.  Either they need to end
with an os.sep or they shouldn&#8217;t.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m sure more will come as I get a chance to write more next week after
Kristina goes back to Texas for a few days.  In unrelated news, I gave
<a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina a new website</a> but she
can&#8217;t use it until after we get married.</p>
