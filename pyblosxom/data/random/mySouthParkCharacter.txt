Ever wondered what a grad student like me would look like as a South Park
character?  Well, I just designed myself.  Feel free to <a href="http://www.planearium2.de/flash/sp-studio-e.html">make your own South Park character</a>.

Mad props to the <a href="http://planet.freedesktop.org/">planet fd.o</a>
folk for showing me this.
