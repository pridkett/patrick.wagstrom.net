For a long time I was a bit of a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) bigot.  I preferred to use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) because it had some more advanced support built in for things like transactions.  Well, the conversion back to MySQL has been pretty nice.  I just found out about [MySQL Control Center](http://www.mysql.com/products/mysqlcc/index.html) which is a nifty GUI by the MySQL people for administering databases.  Although I know SQL, the GUI makes it easy to do simple things.  This is a blessing and probably will result in me using more database driven stuff in the future.
