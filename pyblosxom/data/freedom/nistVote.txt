<p>
The <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and
Technology</a> is holding <a href="http://vote.nist.gov/overview.html">a
seminar</a> on December 10-11th to talk about voting systems.  One of the
issues they will address is computer security and openness.  Unfortunately, I
cannot make it down there because I've got finals that day, anyone else going
that would care to provide a report on this?
