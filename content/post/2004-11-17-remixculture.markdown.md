title: Two Cool New Entries from the Remix Culture

Both of these are courtesy of [BoingBoing](http://boingboing.net/).
The first is that someone went and made a KILLER [video of Encore](http://www.greyvideo.com/) from [The Grey Album](http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html).  Great creativity lies in this video.  Ringo starts
spinnin and John starts break dancing.  If the video goes down (waiting for
the C&D's to start flying) I can probably find a site that has it an hook you
up with it.






The second is the very cool remix from [The
Kleptones](http://www.kleptones.com/) of Queen's a Night at the Opera.  This remix is aptly titled,
[A Night at The
Hip Hopera](http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html).
