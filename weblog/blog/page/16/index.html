  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been trying to keep my blog out of the political realm.
I&#8217;m perfectly aware that there are much better pundits and analysts with much better
connections that a lowly Ph.D. candidate.  Also, I sort of agree with
<a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831">Jon Stewart</a>, partisan bickering
is just bad for America.</p>

<p>Occassionally though, a gem comes across that is too good to miss.  Might I introduce
you to <a href="http://www.pacleansweep.com/">Operation Clean Sweep</a>.  It has but
a single goal, defeat EVERY elected legislator in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
It doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re democrat, republican, or some other third party.  The
premise is that those who govern Pennsylvania are out of touch and need to go.  Given
<a href="http://www.senatorcosta.com/">Senator Jay Costa</a>&#8217;s complete ineptitude
at even providing information about where he stands on issues, much less responding to
my letters, I would tend to agree.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent last week in sunny <a href="http://www.comune.genova.it/index.jsp">Genoa, Italy</a> attending the <a href="http://oss2005.case.unibz.it/">First International Conference on Open Source Systems</a>.  Overall it was a great trip, and I&#8217;ll describe it in a few blog entries here.  This should keep my <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog">read</a><a href="http://www.tylerbutler.com/">ers</a> from lamenting about my lack of content as of late.</p>

<p>I should have realized that something was amiss when <a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a> and I walked out of <a href="http://www.shoprobinsonmall.com/">Robinson Town Center</a> on the way to the airport and saw a couple of F-16 fighters flying around the area.  <a href="http://www.pitairport.com/redirect.jsp">Pittsburgh&#8217;s Airport</a> is also home to an air guard wing or something like that.  The site is also on the list of locations to be closed, because let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not exactly the most strategic location on the planet.  In order to raise the public awareness of the issue they decided to throw together a rather last minute airshow at the airport.  Only problem, is that I didn&#8217;t know this on the way out to catch my 4:20pm flight to Chicago for a 6pm flight to Munich.</p>

<p>Checkin was painless.  Pittsburgh&#8217;s airport always tends to move traffic through security pretty fast.  I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.  I made it to the gate and was able to see all sorts of planes doing fun airshow type stuff.  I thought this was a little odd because surely it conflicted with the airport&#8217;s regular duty schedule.  Surely enough, about five minutes before we were supposed to board my phone rang, it was Orbitz telling my flight was delayed.  They hadn&#8217;t made the announcement at the gate yet, but did so a few minutes later.  Our incoming plane was circling for an extra 20 minutes before they could land.  Sensing that I may end up spending the night I Chicago, I asked if I would make my flight to Munich, they gate agent said yes.</p>

<p>Well, I did make the flight to Munich, but only because I ran from one end of the B-Concourse in O&#8217;Hare to the other end of the C-Concourse.   I was &#8220;that guy&#8221; who held up the whole plane.  Of course, this meant we left Chicago late.  Normally I would think that you could make up time on a long international flight, but we ended up arriving almost an hour late, despite only leaving Chicago about 10 minutes late.  To make things worse, the flight attendant announced that we arrived at 9am, when really it was 10am.  This caused me and a few other people to have to run around in the very nice, and very German, <a href="http://www.munich-airport.de/EN/">Munich airport</a>.</p>

<p>The final flight was a tiny little puddle jumper over Switzerland to Genoa.  It was the first time I flew in a prop plane in about 8 or 10 years.  Landing was fine, despite the rain storm pounding Genoa.  Getting inside I saw that my luggage wasn&#8217;t there.  Somehow between my English and German and their broken knowledge of both I was able to file a missing bag report.   More on that fun later. Unencumbered by luggage, I proceeded to the <a href="http://www.portoantico.it/">Porto Antico</a> to check out the Aquarium and tourist stuff.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2005/07/genoaAquarium.jpg">
        <figcaption>Small panorama of the Genoa aquarium </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>The <a href="http://www.acquario.ge.it/index.asp">Aquarium in Genoa</a> is the largest in Europe and costs about 13€ to enter.  It took me a little over two hours to walk through. Which means that for larger groups expect to budget around 3 hours (the signs say 1.5 - 2 hours, maybe I&#8217;m slow).  Overall it was a pretty nice aquarium with a large amount of information on the native sea life around Genoa and <a href="http://www.regione.liguria.it/">Liguria</a>.  Not too many coral reef
exhibits, which is a bit of a change, but somewhat missed.  Honestly, I probably could have gotten a similar tropical fish experience by driving down to my local <a href="http://www.petco.com/">PetCo</a>.</p>

<p>After the aquarium it was time for next adventure, finding the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hostelge/">hostel</a>.  Unfortunately, I hadn&#8217;t yet gained my &#8220;Italian Legs&#8221; and was still really uncomfortable.  I knew from the tourist info folks what bus I needed to take and where to get it, but not how to take it or what direction to take it.  Through my pitiful Italian skills I was able to explian to the bus driver that I was looking for Ostello della Giovenetu.  He started speaking really fast and I asked him to point where I needed to go.  Apparently I got on the bus going the wrong way.  After a 35 minute bus ride up the hill on the correct bus I arrived at the hostel.  It was a relief to speak English again and understand people, which I had really poor luck with before.  The view was splendid from the hostel, but my luggage still wasn&#8217;t there.</p>

<p>I needed to really rethink how I thought while in Italy.  A couple of key notes.  First of all, unless you&#8217;re in tourist areas, don&#8217;t expect people to understand English.  Where I was in Genoa, I had better luck with German than English.  Secondly, Italy is a bit more relaxed and low key.  Italians don&#8217;t form lines.  They just sorta mass around.  They don&#8217;t stick to time schedules.  Stuff just sorts of happens.   Reminds me of a whole country populated by <a href="http://www.iit.edu/~fockjef/">Jef Fockler</a>&#8217;s.  Once you adjust stuff goes a lot easier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, so knowing my luck no one will get a chance to read this.  I&#8217;m going out of town for
a week or so.  With any luck I won&#8217;t have internet access while I&#8217;m gone.  This means that
scissors will be on autopilot.  This also means that it will probably crash 10 minutes after
I leave for the airport.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in where I&#8217;m going, I&#8217;m presenting some of my research at
<a href="http://oss2005.case.unibz.it/">OSS 2005</a> in Genoa, Italy.  <a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a>

Italian Riviera planned.  Oh well, I&#8217;ll make it up to her when I get back on the 16th.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It appears that <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is well on it&#8217;s path to complete world domination.  Earlier this year they released the excellent <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>. About a week ago they came out with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>.  And today I see that they&#8217;ve finally come up with a suitable home page in <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personalizable Home Page</a>. They don&#8217;t have a ton of options right now, but it suits the geek market pretty nicely.  I can&#8217;t wait until they allow you to have the system automatically snarf random RSS feeds.</p>

<p>All this reminds me, Google still stores everything you do on their site.  That&#8217;s actually really scary.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So we thought that we had won the battle against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag">Broadcast Flag</a>.  The court decision said that
<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> had overstepped their bounds.
Unfortunately this left the possibility for congressional action on the issue.
We had at first thought that it was going to be a new bill, but now we see the
same crap that happened with <a href="http://www.unrealid.com/">Real ID</a>,
namely it has a good chance of being tacked onto an appropriations bill.  This
would virtually mean automatic approval because those things are rarely debated.</p>

<p>So, if you value your freedom to make use of your media and exercise your fair
use rights, then it is <strong><em>CRITICAL</em></strong> that you contact your senator
today.  Especially if your senator is a member of the appropriations committee.
The <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> has a page to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag">contact your senator</a>
and <a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/">Public Knowledge</a> has a list of
<a href="http://www.publicknowledge.org/resources/us-senate-approps-109">senator phone numbers</a> (<a href="http://www.mirrordot.org/stories/8599564d6da19b998eef5eb0a32c6f04/index.html">mirror</a>).</p>

<p>Please, take time to contact your senator.  Especially if you&#8217;re one of my
friends reading this from Pennsylvania or Illinois (your senators are on the
appropriations committee and influential on the committee too).</p>

<time datetime="2005-06-10T15:03:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jun 10<span>th</span>, 2005</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, it looks like <a href="http://www.spreadingsantorum.com/">Senator Santorum</a> (aka
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ffile%3D/news/archive/2003/04/22/national1737EDT0668.DTL">Senator Man-On-Dog in the street</a>) sold out to AccuWeather with
<a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-786">senate bill 786</a>.  The basic gist is this: AccuWeather provides the same data that
National Weather Service does, but for a fee, so the NWS shouldn&#8217;t be able
to provide the data.  Idiot.  Here&#8217;s my letter to Specter on the issue.  As
usual, it&#8217;s not even worth my time to email the same letter to Santorum.</p>

<pre><code>I'm a writing to express my opposition to S.786 - "A bill to clarify
the duties and responsibilities of the National Weather Service, and
for other purposes".  This bill appears to be a shameless sellout by
Senator Santorum to the interests of AccuWeather and against the
citizens and taxpayers of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Not only
does it work against private citizens but it also could put our
national security at risk.  I'll address the two issues seperately.

As a private citizen, and Ph.D. candidate at Carnegie Mellon
University, I enjoy receiving the weather forecasts directly from the
national weather service.  I've written several small tools that do
this and integrated them into a variety of applications (my desktop
computer, cell phone, etc).  This pulls information such as the
temperature, precipitation, and forecast directly from the National
Weather Service.  It's of a great use for me and I'm glad that my tax
dollars help pay for such a valuable service.

However, under the terms of the proposed bill, section 2(b), the only
information that the national weather service can provide for free,
directly to citizens and non-citizens alike, is the severe weather
forecasts.  For me to access the weather data that I find useful in
planning a day out in the park, or my daily walk to the university, I
would need to utilize a commercial service such as AccuWeather
(located in State College, PA, no doubt a major reason why Senator
Santorum proposed this bill).  The problem is that I don't know if
they've changed the forecasts at all.  I don't know and I don't trust
the science behind what they do.  I know the people at the National
Weather Service are competent scientists who do a very good job at
providing accurate weather.  I have no way of knowing if AccuWeather
(or some other commercial provider) is using this information, or
modifying it based on their own assumptions.

Of course, this is placed under the guise of not allowing government
competition with the private sector, however there are some things
that work better when done on a municipal or federal level, like
roads, plumbing, and weather.  I'm already paying for the information
in the form of my taxes, I don't see why I should be forced to pay
AccuWeather or some other service to access the data that can be
better provided directly.  This also will stifle innovation in the
methods of disseminiting weather information, as is often the case
with closed interfaces.  The last time I checked, AccuWeather and
other commercial weather providers, had not found a to integrate
weather into a feather of my Digital Video Recorder, like I have.

The lack of this data is also dangerous because of how it can cripple
valuable resources like SkyWarn, a network of ham radio operators who
provide weather warnings.  Without this information, they would be
unable to provide valuable information about precipitation and wind
speed for large storms.  Ham radio operators have shown time and time
again their value in instances of national emergencies, we should not
cripple this valuable service to bend to the wishes of AccuWeather,
which last time I checked made money without this land grab.

Finally, there is an additional portion of the bill that worries me,
specifically section 2(d).  Part 1 on this seems well founded enough
in that it prevents people affiliated with the NWS from providing
information on the weather before the official service announcement.
However, there are thousands of weather stations in the United States,
some monitored by individual citizens for the NWS, this would prevent
them from notifying others about local conditions if the NWS has not
issued a notice on the condition.

Secondly, part section 2(d)(2) seems particularly ominous as it would
prevent any government employee (wheteher from the NWS or otherwise)
from commenting on a weather phenomenon outside of the scope of what
was issued in the official notice.  This will go further toward the
"talking head" syndrome that our country seems to embrace where
unqualified people comment on subjects of which they have little
knowledge.

This bill is truly dangerous to America and not in the best interests
of your constiuents, the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Thank You,

Patrick Wagstrom

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the mail yesterday I received a claim form to take part in the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=1105">class action settlement</a> against Apple regarding their iPod batteries.  Basically, Apple claimed their batteries lasted longer than they did, and many people were angry about this.  Especially when they saw that Apple charged an arm and a leg to replace the battery.  More information about the whole mess can be found on <a href="http://www.appleipodsettlement.com/">the settlement home page</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one issue.  I&#8217;ve never owned an iPod.  In fact, I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve ever bought any Apple product.  I think they make good products (although I am dismayed about the recent switch to Intel), but I&#8217;ve never actually bought any.  I usually talk myself out of the purchase well before I actually would buy it.  Furthermore, they sent it to me at my new address.  An address that I&#8217;ve only had for about 2 months.  I can guarantee that Apple wouldn&#8217;t have my address here.  Also, it&#8217;s just addressed to &#8220;Patrick&#8221;, no last name on the document.</p>

<p>If it had just said &#8220;Wagstrom&#8221; for the addressee it would make more sense because Kristina bought an iPod mini in April (which is not covered in the proposed settlement).  This all leaves me wondering, how in the world did they actually get my name for this settlement and what caused them to think that I own an iPod?  Just one of those things that makes you shake your head a bit.</p>

I&#8217;ll also talk a little bit about the broadcast flag and why we still need to be on the look out for future similar legislation. For those that are interested in seeing a live system, I&#8217;ll have it running on both my laptop and my desktop while there.  We won&#8217;t be able to play with live TV but you should get a feel for the other features of the system.  If you&#8217;ve got particular issues you&#8217;d like me to talk about, shoot me an email and I&#8217;ll try to work them in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.earthlink.net/">Earthlink</a> has released some very cool <a href="http://www.research.earthlink.net/ipv6/">WRT54G custom firmware </a>that natively supports IPv6 tunneling.  This makes it trivially easy for anyone to set up IPv6 tunnels to their home.  The fact that big time players are hacking away on this little box is incredibly cool.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had IPv6 setup in the past, routing it through my <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD server</a> when I used that as my router.  However, then I was using <a href="http://ipv6tb.he.net/">Hurricane Electric&#8217;s Tunnel Broker</a> service, which unfortunately was not encrypted. The custom firmware does IPSec encryption over the tunnel to Earthlink.  Of course, you&#8217;re still stuck in the situation that all your data can be read by Earthlink.</p>

<p>Anyway, maybe I&#8217;ll get around to installing this, but that means that I&#8217;ll have to set up my second WRT54G for client mode, instead of the current WDS.  Anyway, it&#8217;s all good.  We&#8217;ll see where this goes.  I might just go and put the OpenBSD box back as the router and put my wireless behind it.</p>
