Announcing PennAve

<!-- Date: 2004-05-29 23:07 -->
<p>
Today I went and registered the gallery software over at source forge, and
with that I also named the software, it's going to be called PennAve, which
is a street by my house.  I figure that is better than pyDynaPhotoXMLGallery
or whatever other stupid name most people give to projects.  I'm working
on getting it installed on this server and will post a link to the demo when
it's ready.
