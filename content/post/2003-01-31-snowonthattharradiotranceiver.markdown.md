So my broadband connectivity has really sucked the last few days.   I think
it's because I have snow on the transceiver.  It seems to be working just fine
now, so the site should be better.  Either that or SprintBroadband has got
issues.  I also managed to get everything working for the Zaurii in lab with
the Gentoo Sparc box serving as masquerading box and dhcp server.  When I moved
the WAP11 off the main campus network, it seemed as though the performance
improved quite a bit too.
