  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my last post I got a few emails from folks saying that they didn&#8217;t know what I was up to now-a-days.  I&#8217;m currently working for IBM Research in Hawthorne, NY (just outside of NYC), in their IT Governance group. In other words, I&#8217;m doing similar things at IBM that I&#8217;ve been doing for my thesis research for the last few years.  I&#8217;ll be in the NYC area until at least the end of August.  If you&#8217;re visiting, let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Computer science and information technology is, by its very nature, a complicated field.  I&#8217;m not talking about the math, or abstractions, or models, or classes or any of the other typical things you learn about before graduation from any decent school of computer science.  It&#8217;s complicated because it is one of the few fields which has people in the field trying to actively subvert and destroy the work of many people in the field.  Not only are they actively working aginst other people in the field, but in many cases they don&#8217;t care about the implicit battle lines that have been drawn &#8211; or worse they don&#8217;t realize and/or don&#8217;t care about this dichotomy in the field.</p>

<p>The issue I&#8217;m speaking of is intellectual property.  I realize that some, such as Richard Stallman will argue that intellectual property is an aberration in the legal system and is never codified in law, which is partially true as much of the law surroudning IP is case law, but regardless, it&#8217;s something that is here and thanks to organizations like WIPO, it&#8217;s not going anywhere soon. Every single person who works in creative industries, such as advertising, design, software, journalism, and research, relies on the concept of intellecutal property for their paycheck every day.  As an academic researcher, if someone were to take the output of my research without my permission I would be upset and seek some sort of remedy, such as a formal apology, sanctions, etc. In academia this happens too often, it&#8217;s called being &#8220;duped&#8221; &#8211; where someone else writes the same paper you&#8217;ve already written without adding anything new or properly citing your previous work.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s with the concept of intellectual property in mind that I find working at IBM Research a little interesting.  Working for research is like working at a summer long academic conference.  The students and researchers are always collaborating, presenting ideas, and planning future projects.  The student interns come from the best universities around the world.  Just like a conference, there is a handful of people you may already know, and a score of people whom you&#8217;re waiting to know.  Even though there are a multitude of projects going on at work, they all have one major thing in common,the primary product research produces is intellectual property.  This is evidenced by the multitude of ways that research projects end up in commercial marketed products, the journal papers we publish, and the thousands of patents that IBM receives every year.  There are very few things that come out of research that the bulk of the work cannot be stolen with an iPod set to disk mode.</p>

<p>The workers here are definitely on the creative side.  We enjoy going out and seeing NYC basically every chance we get.  Music and movies tend to be some of the biggest ways that people enjoy their time in the city.  Between the clubs, shows, and free concerts in the parks, there&#8217;s always something to do related to music in the city.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so ironic that so many people around work carry iPods loaded with music that they haven&#8217;t paid for and don&#8217;t have permission to listen to.  I&#8217;m not talking about people who have laboriously ripped their entire CD collection to mp3 files, I&#8217;m speaking of the issue of people downloading music from torrents or those who use tools to get copies of the streamed music from Yahoo or Napster and then remove the DRM from the music.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, I started to note the behavior interns that I work with, many folks are walking around with iPods all day long, even in the hallways.  So, seeking to do some investigating, I posed the following question to a number of interns:</p>

<blockquote><p>Assuming that in all cases you lack permission of the copyright holder, what is the difference between downloading music and movies from the internet and taking a piece of code from a corporation and using it in other endeavors?</p></blockquote>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I worded the question to avoid issues of creative commons licensed music and movies.  It would be great if lived in a world where there was a stable body of content that most people were getting their music from these sources, but it&#8217;s just a fallacy folks tell themselves to feel better.</p>

<p>So lets delve into some of the responses that I&#8217;ve heard from people.  Take note, these are all very intelligent people who are working on getting a Ph.D. in computer science or other related fields.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Is it even illegal?  I thought that it was only illegal if I made a profit.</strong> - All too common of a mistake.  While in most cases casual piracy of music and movies will not yield criminal charges in the United States, it certainly can yield civil charges.  Just ask anyone who has been victim of the RIAA&#8217;s racketeering about that one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It&#8217;s only hurting the companies, not the artists.</strong> - I almost can understand this one.  In most cases the companies have the artists sing heinous contracts that do little benefit to the artist.  I quickly follow up with &#8220;Have you done anything to actually support the artist, such as buying merchandise directly from the artist or going to their shows?&#8221;.  If the answer is no, then this conversation is usually over.  If it is yes, I get a little stymied here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Music and movies are meant to be seen by the masses.  Research data typically is not.</strong> - Once again, I&#8217;m not entirely certain I agree with this. All products have a limited market.  People often perceive the market of music as being bigger because it&#8217;s part of popular culture and a reference point in conversations at bars.  It&#8217;s hard to say that the market for the output from research is smaller because most people don&#8217;t want to talk about it.  When was the last time you tried to pick up a chick in a bar by telling her about your optimization algorithm that helps schedule airline crews?  Ohh, that&#8217;s hot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Corporate research output typically has additional laws protecting it.</strong> - This is interesting, because you see individuals putting a set of levels on the laws.  Copyright infringement is considered minor for these individuals, trade secret infringment is pretty major.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I hate big media.</strong> - This message, or something like it, has come up a few times.  I ask them to remind of that next time they go to see a movie in a theater or crank up the White Stripes on their iPod.  If you really hate something, you choose not participate in it, not to just take the output of it.  The reason I don&#8217;t see movies in the theater is not because I don&#8217;t like movies - I love movies.  I just don&#8217;t like being called a criminal after paying $12 to watch a movie.  So instead of paying to be called a criminal, we reserve movies from the library and watch them at home. If you&#8217;re using this argument you need to make a distinction between the output and their business practices.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Thus far, only one reason has held up: not supporting the record companies. Such logic only works if you buy an artists work through other channels.  I&#8217;m even slightly questioning the long term viability of that as a method for ensuring that artists succeed.  As the record companies can provide a valuable service in promotion of music and concerts.  It&#8217;s true that you can become an internet superstar, but at some point, even most internet superstars sign on with major labels.</p>

<p>The key point is this.  I, and probably most people reading this entry, work in creative industries.  We try very hard to create something unique and useful. However, in almost all cases, these products have almost no copying cost, just like music.  When we&#8217;re copying music without permission of the rights holder, its almost like someone taking my research and incorporating it into a product without allowing me to reap any benefits.  Except there is one major difference, the music industry has other outlets to make money through concerts, last time I checked, people weren&#8217;t turning in droves to watch me develop social network algorithms or extensions for Eclipse.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">PennAve</a>, the web gallery application that works in conjunction with <a href="http://www.f-spot.org/">F-Spot</a> released version 0.4 today.  This newest release brings a slew of new   features including:</p>

<ul>
<li>New user interface</li>
<li>Better support for internationalization</li>
<li>Improvements to splash intro page</li>
<li>Use of the much improved <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy 3.0</a></li>
<li>Option for server side rendering of HTML</li>
<li>Canvas tag support for intro pages</li>
<li>A slew of little bug fixes</li>
</ul>


<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">personal gallery</a> running this newest version yet, but I hope to do so in the next few days.  In the mean time, if you use PennAve, I highly recommend checking out this package for sharing your photos online.  With it, publishing a nice web gallery is as simple as running rsync.  PennAve natively utilizes copies of your F-Spot data files, leaving very little additional work or tools for you. Just create a tag called &#8220;Public&#8221; and start tagging photos that you want share. All while retaining complete control over the presentation of your photos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nearly two weeks ago I called <a href="http://www.house.gov/doyle/">Mike Doyle&#8217;s Office</a> asking him to support <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h2060:">HR 2060</a>, a bill that would save music and netradio as we know it.  At the time I was told that he was meeting with Representive Inslee soon and hadn&#8217;t yet made a decision on the bill.  That was understandable given the fact that Inslee introduced the bill the day before I called.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now been two weeks and there are <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02060:@@@P">51 cosponsors</a> of the bill, and growing. Representative Doyle still is no where to be found on the list of  cosponsors.  In fact, not a single person in Pennsylvania&#8217;s house delegation is a cosponsor.  The same goes for West Virginia&#8217;s tiny house presence.  Ohio has a single cosponsor, representative <a href="http://timryan.house.gov/">Tim Ryan (D-OH-17)</a>, who represents northeastern Youngstown and parts of Akron.</p>

<p>I called Representative Doyle again today and was told that no decision had been made yet on the issue.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that just when Doyle was showing that he may actually be tech savvy, he&#8217;s dragging his feet on the future of music.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s something you may not know.  When you&#8217;re listening to streaming music over the Internet, that site needs to pay a compulsory royalty of 7/100 of a cent per song streamed.  While this may not seem like a lot, it&#8217;s already more than is required of satellite radio, and not really comparable to terrestrial radio because of the inability to accurately measure the people listening.  Back in March, a decision was made that would increase this rate to 19/100 of a penny per song streamed, almost a 3x increase in the price.  In addition, under the current regime, small time webcasters can choose to pay a percentage of revenue, this element has also been removed from the system.</p>

<p>In simple terms, NetRadio is on death row.  To recover those sorts of rates is pretty astronomical.  Basically they&#8217;re asking for about $0.04/hr per listener, or $1/day per listener if you&#8217;re listening 24 hours a day. Extrapolating that out, you&#8217;re looking at $30/mo in just royalties needed per listener.  That number does not include the cost of infrastructure.  For an average listener who listens to NetRadio for a few hours a day at work, you&#8217;re looking at a rate around $5/mo for royalties.  Youch, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to bring in that level of advertising revenue in the new scheme.  As it is most NetRadio is barely making ends meet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s another bigger issue going on here.  Sites such as <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> provide a wonderful way to introduce people to new music.  Without these engines, we&#8217;d be stuck listening to whatever things ClearChannel decides to ram down our ear canals.  Either that, or we&#8217;d turn to P2P networks to &#8220;sample&#8221; the music and then never get around to paying for it.  Well, I suppose another alternative is to give up on music all together.  That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not really ready to do.</p>

<p>Luckily, there are some good things coming related to it.  In Congress, there is the recent introduction of <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2060">H.R. 2060 - The Internet Radio Equality Act</a>.  The bill was just introduced yesterday by Jay Inslee of Washington and currently has no cosponsors.  Without a whole slew of cosponsors, this thing stands little chance of surviving.  So, it&#8217;s simple, get your representative to cosponsor the bill.  Call them up and ask them to cosponsor the bill.</p>

<p>Here in Pittsburgh, I&#8217;m sometimes torn about our congressman, Mike Doyle. As of late, he&#8217;s been noted for his <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/04/27/why-one-congressman-wants-you-to-borrow-more-music/">reference to Girl Talk in a house hearing</a>. I&#8217;d hope that it&#8217;s a safe bet he&#8217;ll get around to cosponsoring the bill, but he has yet to sign on.  According to his aide, a meeting between Doyle and Inslee is scheduled for next week to discuss the issue.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One important aspect of keeping a computer healthy and happy is monitoring its vital stats.  This is especially true of systems that are on 24/7 or that don&#8217;t have a traiditional mode of user interaction.  In my case, my MythTV box fits both of these qualities.  In particular, it&#8217;s important to make sure that the fans are running and none of the drives or processors in the machine are running abnormally hot, as this could indicate a malfunction within the machine and should be looked at.</p>

<p>Linux provides a multitude of methods to get at various sensor information on your computer, the most common method is with the lm-sensors package. This suite of tools interacts with various sensors that are built into most every piece of x86 compatible hardware.  Typically you&#8217;ll just use the command sensors to get a status list, such this listing from my MythTV box:</p>

<pre><code>w83627thf-isa-0290
Adapter: ISA adapter
VCore:     +1.09 V  (min =  +1.94 V, max =  +1.94 V)       ALARM
+12V:     +12.40 V  (min = +10.82 V, max = +13.19 V)
+3.3V:     +3.14 V  (min =  +3.14 V, max =  +3.47 V)
+5V:       +4.93 V  (min =  +4.75 V, max =  +5.25 V)
-12V:     -12.11 V  (min = -10.80 V, max = -13.18 V)       ALARM
V5SB:      +4.97 V  (min =  +4.76 V, max =  +5.24 V)
VBat:      +2.94 V  (min =  +2.40 V, max =  +3.60 V)
fan1:        0 RPM  (min = 5075 RPM, div = 2)              ALARM
CPU Fan:  2812 RPM  (min = 2636 RPM, div = 8 )
fan3:     5037 RPM  (min = 61363 RPM, div = 2)              ALARM
M/B Temp:    +37°C  (high =  +111°C, hyst =   +72°C)   sensor = thermistor
CPU Temp:  +25.5°C  (high =   +80°C, hyst =   +75°C)   sensor = thermistor
temp3:     +10.5°C  (high =   +80°C, hyst =   +75°C)   sensor = diode
vid:      +0.275 V  (VRM Version 9.0)
alarms:
beep_enable:
          Sound alarm enabled
</code></pre>

<p>The top little confusing string just indicates what sensors interface the program is using.  Beneath that is a listing of sensors and their current values, you&#8217;ll notice that there are measurements for all of the voltages from your power supply, fan speeds, and motherboard and cpu temperatures.  It may take a little looking to figure out what all of these mean and why some of them may not have have values that intially make sense.  For example, I only have two fans on my system, the CPU fan and northbridge, which is why it says 0 RPM for the value of fan1.  I&#8217;ve also noticed that the voltage tends to get confused by powernow setups, especially when you&#8217;ve gone through and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/custom-powersaving-kernel-for-profit.xml">modified your DSDT table to save some extra power</a>.  Ensuring that these values are nominally appropriate is a key element for computer health as if the voltages sway too much they can cause interference with the PCI bus, as was my problem with pcHDTV cards and the original Antec power supply in my Antec Overture II case.</p>

<p>While the lm-sensors package monitors lots of things, there are many other sensors in your system that don&#8217;t have such a uniform interface.  For example, you the nvclock application can provide a wealth of knowledge surrounding <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">nvidia</a> video cards.  Here&#8217;s a snippet of what you can expect from running nvclock -i:</p>

<pre><code>-- General info --
Card:           nVidia Geforce 6600LE
Architecture:   NV43 A4
PCI id:         0x142
GPU clock:      9.705 MHz
Bustype:        PCI-Express

-- Pipeline info --
Pixel units: 4 (10b)
Vertex units: 3 (111b)
HW masked units: pixel 01b vertex 000b
SW masked units: None

-- Memory info --
Amount:         256 MB
Type:           128 bit DDR
Clock:          12.846 MHz

-- Sensor info --
Sensor: GPU Internal Sensor
GPU temperature: 52C

-- VideoBios information --
Version: 05.43.02.69.02
Signon message: GeForce 6600 LE BIOS
Performance level 0: 300MHz / 400MHz
</code></pre>

<p>Not only does it correctly identify the exact video card you&#8217;re using, but it also provides information about the performance levels and clock rates the card is running at.  Here we see that when my monitor is off, as it was when I ran this, the card slows itself down to conserve extra power.  We also see that the interal GPU temperature is 52C.  This is a little bit of a concern, but should be taken lightly as the card is a first generation fanless GeForce 6600 and has a fairly poor heat sink.  It frequently overheats in games like Quake 4.</p>

<p>Not to be left out, hard drives also have an amazing amount of information available at your finger tips.  Almost every IDE or SATA hard drive out there is compatible with SMART, which is an automated tested and analysis system for hard drives.  Up until last month, it was widely thought that temperature and usage loads were high correlated to drive failure, however thanks to some clever research out of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>, we&#8217;ve seen that for the most part <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/schroeder.html">failure rates grow with time</a> and have little to do with other parameters.  Folks from Google published a similar paper in which they looked at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/pinheiro.html">drive failures across a large enterprise</a> and found consistent results.  Now it just means that we can make nifty graphs and re-evaluate if we need more fans in our systems.  Anyway, the <a href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/">smartmontools</a> package is a great set of tools that monitors drive parameters and can automatically alert you if a drive is going bad.  Of course, I&#8217;ve had drives that smartmontools was complaining about for years that kept on working.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to collect all this information, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if it were done automatically and stored in a database with a nice web interface?  Yes it would.  That&#8217;s where SensorGraph comes along.  SensorGraph is a python script that reads the values of all of the sensors and stores them into a database for further analysis.  I typically run the program once every fifteen minutes.  Then to look at my system, I created a web interface to SensorGraph that utilizes <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUPlot</a> to create some SVG graphs for visualization of trends.  Throw in some nice javascript interface, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a nice little setup to look at your system.  If you&#8217;d like to get a copy of SensorGraph, you can check it out from my subversion at <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/sensorGraph">https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/sensorGraph</a>. If you&#8217;d like to see a demo of sensor graph&#8217;s web interface, I&#8217;ve put up a <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/test.cgi">small demo site</a> that uses some static information from my MythTV box.  I would have a live information setup for my web server, but it&#8217;s a virtual machine, so most of the sensor interfaces aren&#8217;t present or return garbage information.</p>

<p>Using all of these tools, I can quickly look at the health of my drives and CPU and tell if something is going wrong.  It also provides a nice reminder of what days were warmer because I can see days that the CPU was typically warmer, indicating that it was probably warmer outside.  Not entirely practical, but perhaps helpful.  In the future I&#8217;d like to add the ability to calculate some trend lines and a sliding window for the graphs to better get an idea of the health of the machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started what could be called a weblog, sometime back in 2000, it was mainly a little place for me to scribble my thoughts about what was going on in my life.  You can see a snapshot from early 2002 at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011204203509/http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/">the Internet archive</a>.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t a copy on the archive from the origins of my weblog.  At the time, there wasn&#8217;t any large scale concern about privacy on the internet or employers examining personal web pages before hiring people.  I think the only people who ever really looked at my weblog at the time were friends at <a href="http://www.iit.edu/">IIT</a> or co-workers of mine.</p>

<p>Most of these entries were short little bits talking about what was going on my life.  Very similar to how the kids use MySpace today.  In retrospect, it was eerily similar to a primitive MySpace.  However, as you know, you can learn a lot about people by looking at their myspace pages.  Everything from political affiliations, to tastes in music, to where people, to their current infatuation with the opposite sex.  If the parents of those 14-year-olds realized the risk they were taking by allowing their kids to have MySpace pages, I doubt they&#8217;d let them post so much information.  Fortunately, MySpace has gotten better and added in protections to allow pages to only be viewed by &#8220;friends&#8221;, preserving some aspect of privacy.</p>

<p>However, this weblog serves a very different purpose.  I&#8217;m not trying to convey what sort of mood I&#8217;m in, or what I had for lunch today.  Rather, I use it as a feedback environment for new ideas and a place to post nifty little pieces of technological gadgetry that I&#8217;ve developed, mostly related to Linux and Programming. I&#8217;ve come to realize that I too had way too much information on my weblog.  With a little digging it would be far too easy to find out my political views, lots of details about my wife, where I lived, or how I was feeling on certain days.  All of that information is completely orthogonal to the purpose of this weblog and only puts me at risk as I go out from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a> in the reasonably near future.  Furthermore, a better question is this: Does anyone really care about the fact that I had a bad reaction to some mexican food in the summer of 2002?</p>

<p>Thus, I&#8217;ve done something that I originally told myself I would never do - I&#8217;ve removed 234 entries from this weblog that addressed issues that were not core to the nature of the weblog.  Some were removed because they had little value, such as a posting about wiring problems in my apartment in Chicago, while others were removed because they contained profanities, views that I no longer hold, or political statements which I really shouldn&#8217;t be making.  I tended to keep the political views on technology, because I believe that&#8217;s an important focus of this weblog.  However, my writings on the war, abortion, Palestine, etc have all been removed.  Instead, if you visit their former pages you&#8217;ll get a message saying the page has been sanitized and a link is provided to this weblog article.</p>

<p>As far my personal beliefs about publishing on the Internet, over the last few months, I&#8217;ve become much more skeptical of it.  I believe that focused weblogs can be a powerful thing for change, for example <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/">Ed Felton&#8217;s &#8220;Freedom to Tinker&#8221;</a> is a great example of a focused weblog.  It provides value for people to read entries and comment.  Unfocused general weblogs, on the other hand, often provide too much information and put the author at risk.  In the future, I hope to not be forced to remove entries that I&#8217;ve written, but I will certainly be much more cautious about such entries.  Also, I realize that it&#8217;s possible to find most of my previous writings in this weblog.  If you&#8217;re that desperate for information, knock yourself out.  I&#8217;m just not providing direct links to it anymore.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the dark old days of the internet, I used to run a weblog using a few ad hoc PHP scripts.  They broke a lot and generally weren&#8217;t well maintained.  Somtime later I started to use <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. After all, it was 2001, and that was all the rage back then.  However, as a devotee of the &#8220;Dump Perl for the good of all humanity&#8221; movement, I wan&#8217;t too keen about running a set of Perl CGI scripts on my webserver.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Movable Type was great and all, but it was still Perl.  Which meant it was nigh impossible to hack on.  Sometime later, with the release of Movable Type version 3, the license changed to something that was decidely un-free and un-cool.  I don&#8217;t remember the details, but I just remember not particularly liking the change.</p>

<p>In late summer of 2003 I moved to Pittsburgh, and for a few months, my entire website went dark.  Then it came back online using some hokey methods to make it accessible on my Verizon DSL line.  I began to search for a new weblog system that met most of my requirements.  Namely, that it was written in Python, because that was my language du jour at the time (and for the most part, still is).  I found lots of different options, but none seemed really complete.  I finally settled on <a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/">PyBlosxom</a>.  It was completely file based, so it seemed pretty simple to setup.  Almost everything was done via plugins, which also was quite cool.  It was a pretty minimalistic weblog system.  For the most part it worked for me.</p>

<p>As time went on, I added some new features to PyBlosxom, and saw the software move into the life support stage of development.  The original architecture was pretty cool, but it wasn&#8217;t quite structured the right way for all the stuff I wanted to do.  I undertook a painful process to augment the infrastructure of Pyblosxom to give it some XML/XSLT rendering framework, and produce what you see today.  I find it marginally a pain to administer, but it works for the most part.  Anyway, since switching to PyBlosxom, I&#8217;ve lacked the ability to allow for reader comments on the page.  I&#8217;m not sure why, probably because I was getting lots of spam on my Movable Type weblog back in the day.  However, a lot has changed with  weblogs in the three and a half years that I&#8217;ve used PyBlosxom, and the time has come to hack together more stuff into my PyBlosxom implementation.  That&#8217;s right, effective today, commenting exists once again.  Halleluja!</p>

<p>The commenting system isn&#8217;t perfect.  It basically translates every message into plain text, replacing carriage returns with &lt;br&gt; tags, but it seems to work well enough.  Consider it to be another ball of duct tape on top of the mess of scripts that holds this website together.  Anyway, so feel free to try and leave some comments.  If people really hammer the system, I&#8217;ll probably be forced to modify the script for more anti-spam stuff and what not.  For right now, I&#8217;m counting on the fact that the system is unique to keep the spambots away. And with that, let the conversations (or lack thereof) begin.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I went through and decided to give my weblog a facelift.  Originally I had intended it to be much more exhaustive, but I settled on something pretty simple for right now.  I&#8217;d still like to add the ability to leave comments at some point in the near future.  However, it always comes down to this issue of updating my Pyblosxom software, which is so incredibly branched from old school version 0.8, or writing new software.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;ve got comments on the new style, email them to me.  I&#8217;ll add the ability for comments in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of the preparation for PennAve 0.4, I&#8217;d like to give the application a little bit of branding magic.  So, if anyone out there has some graphics talent and would like to give me a hand, I could use a logo for PennAve.  My original thought was to take a photo of the street sign at the corner of Penn Ave and Main St here in Pittsburgh and then trace that to make a vector graphic for the logo.  But obviously, if you&#8217;re an artist and have a better idea, I certainly am open to it.  So, artists of the world, immortalize yourself in free software.  Submit a logo today!</p>
