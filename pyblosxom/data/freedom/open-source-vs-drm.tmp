Open Source and the Right to Market DRM

<!-- Date: 2007-10-03 16:43 -->
<p>
Last weekend was the fifth annual <a
href="http://www.ohiolinux.net/">Ohio LinuxFest</a> in Columbus,
Ohio.  This event has consistently grown for the last few years to the
point where it now attracts about 1,000 attendees -- making it one of
the larget Linux events in the US, and almost certainly the largest
free Linux event.  The conference always does a good job attracting a
wide variety of presenters, sponsors, and attendees.  It's not unusual
to see a handful of Free software hackers in attendence, lots of folks
from the business world, and a few folks who just showed up because
they heard the event was free.  This variety causes significant
differences in opinions on issues such as support for Linux distros,
mixing of Open Source and proprietary software, and who the target
market for Linux really should be.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, one thing that almost everyone seemed to be
complete agreement on -- DRM is bad and the RIAA and MPAA can suck
it.  Wandering around the conference floor was the usual handful of
folks wearing "clever" shirts regarding those fine institutions.  As
expected, the topic took even more prevalence during the evening
keynote talk by <a href="http://ebb.org/bkuhn/">Bradley Kuhn</a>, who
currently works for the <a
href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law
Center</a>, an organization that provides legal support for Free and
Open Source projects, include the Free Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>
Bradley gave an excellent talk describing the organization and why the
whole SCO debacle may have actually done the community a favor --
largely because SCO made the mistake of suing IBM.  He then entered
into a talk about the new versions of the GPL licenses and why they
featured the anti-"tivoization" clause (on an aside, TiVo apparently
was very cooperative when it came to remedying their faults with
regards to GPL requirements, so the term probably is not the best).
He iterated that Free Software is about protecting your rights to use
the software and ensuring that you can use the software however you
really want to.  This means that Free Software is naturally on a
collision course with DRM, because DRM is designed to do exactly the
opposite -- it limits the amount of freedom you can have with a piece
of software.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate his point, he told of his issues with DRM and his quest
to get a missed episode of "<a href="http://www.thislife.org/">This
American Life</a>".  At the time, his only option for getting the old
episode was to purchase the episode through <a
href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible.com</a>, which meant it came
wrapped with DRM.  This DRM meant that it wasn't going to be usable on
his Linux desktop or on his Neuros media player, which were the
preferred devices.  In essence, the DRM was keeping him from utilizing
something for which he paid for.  As time went on, the value of the
episode went up because he could not get access to it.  Eventually,
the value was so high, that it became easier just to break the DRM and
listen to the episode.  After all, he'd paid for it.
</p>
<p>
However, I believe that such an argument breaks down.  In the United
States, we have an almost purely market based economy -- especially
with regards to entertainment goods and computer software.  Providers
of these products are free to charge whatever they want in exchange
for a license to use the product.  If a provider believes they are
creating something of more value, then the price goes up.  One needs
only to look at the price difference between DVDs and HD-DVDs, or how
the different versions of Windows Vista have different price points.
Basically, it's a market segmentation and price discrimination issue,
trying to get the most money out of the market.  Apple believes that
this will work with downloadable media, as evidenced by the $1.29 they
charge for non-DRM files with a slightly higher bitrate.  
</p>
<p>
In essence, what you have is a bit of an agreement between you and
producer of the item.  You agree to certain features, both good and
bad, for a certain price.  In software this manifests itself in
licenses that say that you cannot use the software for certain
commercial purposes.  In music it may be a restriction on how you can
use the media, through DRM.  This is even present in software under
the GNU General Public License, which says that you don't have the
freedom to keep your modifications private should you chose to
distribute the software.
</p>
<p>
However, being as it is a market economy, other folks are free to make
competing products with different feature sets and available under
different license.  Independent bands frequently allow high quality
MP3s to be traded online.  This is a huge benefit over what you'd get
from iTunes in both price and technical quality, however the content
of the files frequently makes it painfully obvious why the band was
independent in the first place.  That brings us back to "This American
Life".  Ira Glass and crew had decided to set a price point with
certain feature requirements, in this case it was something like $0.95
with DRM attached to it.  As a consumer, we have the choice to accept
the deal, try to negotiate a better deal, or search for other
content.  I don't forsee us being able to negotiate a one off deal
with Chicago Public Radio for a $3.99 version without DRM.
</p>
<p>
That leaves us with the choice of looking for another product.  The
problem here, is that "This American Life" has a set of features of
interest.  In particular, the topic of the episode in question was
particularly interesting and the style of the reporting was familiar
and high quality.  There may be writing or even audio about the topic
available elsewhere on the Internet, but it wouldn't be the same
product.  Therefore, the only choice if we really desire the actual
item is to remove the DRM from the file and unilaterally change the
contract between us and the content producer.
</p>
<p>
Now, lets think about how this relates to Free and Open Source
software.  Suppose we have a GPL based product that we'd like to use
in our application, such as the <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html">MySQL
Connector/J</a> component for accessing MySQL databases from Java.
This application is free to use internally -- you can go and modify
the code to your hearts content, and as long as it's not
redistributed, you bear no additional restrictions.  However, one of
the conditions of the code being provided at zero cost is that if you
distribute something based on the code, that others get the same
access you had.  If you'd like to change the restrictions, you're free
to pay some money to MySQL AB and get a version under a different
license.  Although MySQL advertises this feature, there are other open
source projects that do the same thing.
</p>
<p>
In this sense, what we're doing with the Free software licenses is
very similar to what happens with DRM.  We provide a version of a
product with a particular feature set and some restrictions at a
particular cost, in most cases $0.00.  If you chose to go beyond that
then you'll need to contact the developers to work something out.  In
some cases they may not respond, in other cases they'll say it's not
an option.  In any case, you still have the option of searching for a
replacement product.  Nothing is forcing you to use the Free software.
</p>
<p>
Now, let's consider what happens when someone unilaterally decides to
change the agreement by shipping modified GPL software without
providing access to the code.  In this case, they have violated the
license agreement and usually do an out of court settlement to remedy
the issues that arose from their abuse of the license.  Contributors
to the project and members of the community are irate because their
code has been taken and modified without their consent in a way they
didn't intend.  Sound familiar?  It bears more than a passing
resemblance to the issues with DRM.
</p>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that Free and Open Source Software relies on
copyrights and license agreements to ensure the product we create is
Free.  We expect people to adhere to those agreements and not
unilaterally modify those agreements.  We're exerting control over the
future development and use of code through these agreements.  It's not
that much different from what DRM does.
</p>
<p>
I contacted Bradley for his view on the situation, and the distinction
in his mind was that DRM related products have an additional technical
mechanism that enforces the agreement.  This technical layer is
illegal to break in the United States because of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act.  However, in the past, I remember that some Free
software developers were very irate when their works were ported to
non-free environments.  I have to wonder, if the mechanism had been
available when porting of Free software to Windows first happened,
would project have used it?
</p>
<p>
The fact of the matter is that music and software have a lot more in
common than we'd like to admit.  Both are principally intellectual
works that can be easily copied for little or no cost.  Both rely on
license agreements to make it a viable economic activity.  Both of
them face massive amounts of people who have no respect for these
agreements.  The market gives both Free software and content providers
the right to market their product with restrictions attached.  It
seems as though if you're arguing against the right to produce DRM,
then others may argue against the right to create Free software.  I
believe that if you're arguing for one, you need to at least admit
that the other can exist.  It's just unfortunate that many people in the Free
software community don't seem to see it that way.
