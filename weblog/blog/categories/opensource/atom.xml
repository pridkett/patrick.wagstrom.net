    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/03/open-source-and-technology-predictions-for-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I did for <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2010/">2010</a> and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">2011</a>, I've created a set of predictions for the coming year around Open Source. However, this year I've expanded it to the general field of technology. These are all fairly specific things that I should be able to verify sometime near the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>SOPA dies a bloody death</strong> - While I don't think that Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, and Facebook will enact the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/29/1049815/-Internet-giants-seriously-considering-nuclear-option-to-stop-SOPA">"Nuclear Option" for stopping SOPA</a> (largely because of business agreements that Google, Amazon, and Facebook all have with other companies), I do expect that if this horribly misguided bill looks like it will pass that they will do something VERY dramatic. This bill is a critical threat to the internet and freedom because it breaks DNS, makes sites more vulnerable to attacks, and circumvents the judicial process. It must be stopped. Also, <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Franken, I'm glad you're my senator, but you've lost my vote and all future support if you continue to support SOPA and PIPA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy regulations for children under 13 are revisited</strong> - This is a bit of a risky prediction because Congress has enacted hordes of horrible laws under the guise of protecting children. However, as it the internet becomes more important for younger children, it is inevitable that we'll need to revisit laws regarding children under 13 using internet services. We can't have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google-thanks-for-making-my-daughter-cry/2011/12/12/gIQAhYx9pO_blog.html">Google go around disabling children's accounts</a> when they create <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk">ads showing email accounts for children</a>. Facebook likewise faces similar challenges. Maybe we'll finally get the point where we inject common sense and let parents do their job of monitoring their children. Or, probably not. In any case, look for child online privacy to be revisited in the next year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Major automobile software fault</strong> - I drive a pretty bare bones car, but many folks like to have cars with all the bells and whistles. According to an <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/this-car-runs-on-code">IEEE Spectrum report, premium cars contain more than 100 million lines of code</a>. I know enough about software to know that's a problem. Given that automobile manufacturers seek to reuse components within their own brand, or even <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Auto_IWG">with their competitors</a>, and it is rather difficult to upgrade the software on these automobiles, it is only a matter of time before a major fault shows up across an entire brand. Some people may point to Toyota's problem with "unintended acceleration", to which I'll gently direct to the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/UA">National Highway Transportation Safety Agency's final report on unintended acceleration in Toyota automobiles which found no such evidence</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boxee calls it quits</strong> - Boxee already called it quits on desktop after releasing a completely unusable new version. They're facing a mountain of challenges from content providers and hardware manufacturers. The Boxee Box has only been kinda warmly received, and although the <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/live">forthcoming Live TV add on will help</a>, it still only works with ATSC/Clear QAM. Unless they get support for CableCard and recording I don't see how Boxee can survive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GNOME falls apart</strong> - <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> has seen better days. Gone are the halcyon days when I used to eagerly await the new release of GNOME in March and September. Now new GNOME releases are more of a "meh" thing. With so many things on the web the operating system just doesn't matter as much. Combine this with fragmentation among the distros, thanks to Canonical being blockheaded with Unity, and formerly large sponsors dropping away from the project (Maemo, Meego, Tizen, who cares?), and I think that GNOME may reach the breaking point this year. Unfortunately, problems in GNOME will cascade to the rest of the Linux desktop world. By the way, did you hear that 2012 is the year of Linux desktop? Just like it has been every year since I started using the Linux desktop seventeen years ago. Ugh.
<img src="/media/2012/01/Netflix-2011-Share-Price.png"></p></li>
<li><strong>Netflix gets acquired and Reed Hastings gets fired</strong> - While there have been companies that have been more mismanaged, Tyco and Enron come to mind, there are few that have messed up so spectacularly without violating any laws. Netflix probably did the right thing in trying to jettison the expensive and dying disc business, but going streaming only, which is the way of the future, leaves them at the mercy of the studios. Netflix will be acquired, most likely by a large network provider without content, such as Verizon. There's an off chance that given it's current $3B valuation it may get swooped up by private capital, but that seems unlikely as private capital lacks both content and distribution mechanisms. In fact, Netflix going private is almost as unlikely as Reed Hastings finishing the year as CEO of Netflix. Need more evidence for this future? Check out their stock price over the past year:

	</figure></notextile></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Go gets a killer project</strong> - I think that <a href="http://golang.org/">Go programming language from Google</a> has a lot of interesting concepts that make it nice alternative to the current dominant languages of Java and C#. Unfortunately, it needs a killer project before people will start to use it (similar to Rails and Ruby). My guess is that this is the year that will happen. Expect Google to show off something big and cool at I/O in June that attracts tens of thousands new developers to the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Android continues to grow, but not at the expense of iOS</strong> - this will be a continuation of current trends. Both Android and iOS are growing. Pundits say this is at the expense of RIM and Microsoft, but in reality its just that its more people moving from feature phones to smart phones that they use only as phones with nice on screen keyboards. iOS will remain the dominant smartphone platform in terms of mindshare.

	</figure></notextile></div></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internet political meltdown</strong> - After watching the SOPA hearings live it became clear that most of our politicians don't have a clue about how the internet and social media work. Even those who have been bitten by the internet (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=santorum">Googled "Santorum" before?</a>) don't really understand how poor actions and the genius of a single individual can cause such a huge problem. Expect at least one candidate for Federal office (congress or president) to have a meltdown due to something that happened on the Internet. Of course, some might say this already happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_(U.S._politician">George Allen with "macaca"</a>#.22Macaca.22_controversy), but I'm expecting something bigger this year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shakeup at the Free Software Foundation</strong> - Let's be perfectly clear: I do not wish ill upon <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">the Free Software Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>. They do great things for freedom and I am eternally in their debt. However, the divide between the FSF and the rest of the Open Source world continues to grow. The GPL is no longer the go-to license for new Open Source projects. Their campaigns against DRM and service based systems are negative campaigns. If you want to win people to your side, do something that gets people excited and presents a better alternative. When that happens the FSF will thrive. Unfortunately, the FSF recently has engaged in childish spats around software freedom and when you lower yourself to that level you have to expect that one of your spokepeople will eventually do something massively stupid and cause a major controversy to ensue.</p></li>

<p>So, what do you think? Did I pick a bunch of easy predictions for 2012? What do you think will happen this year?</p>

    <updated>2012-01-02T22:15:59-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/02/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year means that it is time to revisit <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">the predictions about Open Source and technology in 2011 I made at the end of 2010</a>. As before, I've tried to be entirely honest with my assessment. If I've got something wrong please leave a comment and I'll correct it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>On the PC front Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming, although they’ll finally get their act together and make it work well with GPU acceleration. Interfaces for Netflix will all move the route of the PS3 and adopt an HTML based interface.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly true</strong> - Netflix still requires Silverlight, arguably making it the only thing that is keeping Microsoft from killing Silverlight. Apparently the GPU acceleration issue is more due to Silverlight than Netflix, so I can't totally fault them there. Although, seriously, Flash and HTML5 both feature GPU acceleration. Most of the interfaces have moved to pure HTML - with the Windows Media Center (developed and supported by Microsoft) and XBox 360 interfaces being notable exceptions. It seems as though Netflix has a Microsoft problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google will meet it’s match and discover that the movie and TV studios really don’t want to work with them and will be forced to pull the plug on Google TV.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly false</strong> - Google TV has had it's problems this year. In November, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/11/logitech-says-google-tv-was-a-big-mistake.html">Logitech, one of the biggest supporters or Google TV said it was a huge mistake</a> and had cost them $300 million. Nonetheless, Google TV soldiers on. Given the reduction in support for Windows Media Center, it seems that if Google TV ever got Live TV and timeshifting support it could be a great product. We'll see what Google says at I/O this year, but I highly doubt that Google TV is going the way of the dodo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Although Google will continue to tout the number of Android phones available as a success metric for the project, it will continue to see fragmentation and iPhone will remain the phone to beat.</strong>
<strong>True</strong> - I could be generous and describe Android as a clusterfuck. However, I'll let <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">this chart about long term Android support</a> do all the talking for me. I realize that the chart talks about support, but it's one very major piece of many problems in Android.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Despite all of the Android tablets and the upcoming Blackberry Playbook, the iPad will remain dominant and continue to sell more than all the other tablets combined.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I didn't anticipate the Kindle Fire, but given that every other tablet has landed with relatively loud thuds I think this is a safe claim. The iPad is still the tablet to beat in the market. There are tablets that are faster and have more features, but they're still chasing the iPad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RIM will introduce a new OS for their phones based on the Playbook’s OS. The OS will be open sourced but will fail to attract any sort of market movement.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/12/07/poor-rim-renames-bbx-blackberry-10-due-to-trademark-woes/">RIM introduced BBX, later renamed Blackberry 10</a>. RIM does provide <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/research-in-motion-announces-bbx-combines-the-best-of-blackber/">over 100 Open Source libraries for Blackberry 10</a>, but the core operating system is not Open Source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chromium OS from Google will land like a lead balloon. Initial reviews of the device will be severely hampered by the inability to access many services without Internet access.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I travel a lot. I see lots of people with lots of gadgets. I've never seen someone with a Chromebook. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/">Early reviews of Chromebooks were less than glowing</a>. I don't recall seeing any big push for Chromebooks for the holidays. I'm open to evidence to the contrary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The browser wars will continue to heat up (hello, 1998!). Firefox’s market share will remain relatively stagnant while Chrome’s market share grows. This stagnation will result in some shakeups at Mozilla as they attempt to re-evaluate the market landscape. This will eventually lead to a new and lighter desktop browser based off Firefox.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - Chrome has continued to gain market share and Firefox has fallen off. However, Mozilla has not experienced any major shakeup. Rather they've become more focused on their core purpose of delivering an open web. It seems as though the browser is secondary, which is probably a good thing overall.
<img src="/media/2012/01/StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-201012-201112.png"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source hardware outside of Android will generally continue to falter. This includes OLPC and the Boxee Box (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>Kinda True</strong> - Although Boxee is doing better than I would have expected it seems as though the only Open Source consumer hardware people talk about is Android based. I am, however, only marking this as kinda true because the variety of Open Source hardware available for the maker community (arduinos, rep raps, maker bots, lasersaurs, etc), is staggering. I was referring to consumer hardware in the original prediction, but I wasn't specific enough to call this completely true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ll see the first lawsuit regarding ownership of code in an Open Source project after the code of an original author has been patched out and the project license changed (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>False</strong> - I haven't seen anything like this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apache will have a significant long term shakeup regarding their relationship with Java. I’d imagine that this means that the Java projects are jettisoned into a new foundation.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly False</strong> - Although Apache has taken it's hits this year, mainly because of it being lured into Oracle's anti-community trap related to OpenOffice.org, there hasn't been a major shakeup.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Total score: 3 completely true, one mostly true, two half true, one kinda true. Assigning point values of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 for each of those categories, my total score is 5. About 50% of a perfect score, although I had some element of truth to 7 out of 10 of my predictions. Not bad, we'll see how my career as a pundit progresses in 2012.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on the heels of my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010/">somewhat successful predictions regarding Open Source for 2010</a>, I now my present my 10 predictions for Open Source in 2011.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the PC front Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming, although they'll finally get their act together and make it work well with GPU acceleration. Interfaces for Netflix will all move the route of the PS3 and adopt an HTML based interface.</p></li>

<li><p>Apache will have a significant long term shakeup regarding their relationship with Java.  I'd imagine that this means that the Java projects are jettisoned into a new foundation.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are a few predictions in this list that are rather ambitious - particularly the creation of a new browser from Mozilla and pulling the plug on Google TV. I was at least partially right on 5/10 predictions last year, I'm feeling a little more confident this year and saying that I'll get 6 correct this year, making me correct more often then not.</p>

<p>What at your thoughts on these predictions?  Too much? Too easy?</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-31T12:00:46-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As 2009 came to a close and 2010 started I decided to put all of my schooling and research to good use and attempt some short term prognostication. I entered the realm of people making predictions for 2010. Here's a recap of <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2010/">my predictions for 2010</a> and how everything shook out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Foundation</a> will undergo a major upheaval related to community/corporate structure and governance.</strong><br/>
Wrong - As near as I can tell there was no upheaval in the Eclipse Foundation.  The Foundation continues to grow and release some really high quality software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Highly customized hardware running on Open Source will continue to under-perform, particularly OLPC and Litl</strong><br/>
Correct - OLPC stayed relatively out of the news this last year.  Most of the talk has focused around the XO-3 that is expected to be revealed at CES 2011. The biggest news that I remember seeing about OLPC is that the display technology was available from Pixel Qi and you could hack it into your netbook.  Very cool, but not what OLPC set out to do.  As for Litl, the only real time I heard about them over the past year was when they sponsored elements of the Boston GNOME Summit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Netflix on Linux</strong><br/>
Correct - This was almost too easy. Next year I'll predict that Mac users are smug.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Boxee Box will underperform</strong><br/>
Correct - The Boxee Box was delayed because of a switch to an Intel architecture, a decision that makes it very similar to a Google TV device. Complete with the drawbacks of content blocking.  However, somewhat orthogonal, it appears that HTPC and embedded attached devices are still a niche market. Apple made some nice inroads with the new version of Apple TV, but that's not open source. Given the tepid reviews of the Boxee Box, I'd say this was Correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google will suffer a major privacy problem and be quiet about it</strong><br/>
Mostly Correct - Google did have a bit of a privacy leak, but not quite in the way that I thought.  Google Buzz proved to be a privacy disaster for them and it took them a while to respond.  They were eventually <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/google-settles-suit-over-buzz-and-privacy/">sued over buzz and lost, but no compensation was due to users</a>. I'd say that I'm 75% correct on this one, I'm taking off some because they did respond.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A major Open Source community will disassociate itself from the Free Software Foundation</strong><br/>
Wrong - I don't recall any major Open Source community attempting to disassociate itself from the FSF.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GNOME's reliance on commercial firms will cause a schism and no one will care about GNOME in tablets and phones</strong><br/>
Half Correct - This prediction was sloppy and really should have been two different predictions. It still appears that very few people care about MAEMO/MeeGo.  The Nokia N8 is a niche device that even ubernerds tend to eschew. This doesn't appear to have caused many problems for GNOME, however. Therefore, right on one, wrong on another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ubuntu will remove at least one major application and direct users to the cloud.</strong><br/>
Wrong - Nothing of the sort happened.  In retrospect this was a foolish prediction given how Ubuntu pushes itself for rural communities which may have poor network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rights of Open Source authors will be challenged as a project evolves and code from the original authors no longer exists.</strong><br/>
Wrong - I searched and couldn't find any example of such a scenario when the original code from an author has been entirely removed and the license changed. Maybe this is too much of a stretch, or maybe it just didn't make enough news.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>At least one major project will transition from the GPL to a more business friendly license</strong><br/>
Wrong - Although every year a handful of smaller projects switch licenses, I don't remember seeing any major projects switch from the GPL to a more business friendly license.  If anything, major GPL projects seem to have become stronger in their defense of the GPL (e.g. Wordpress).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Total score: 3 correct, 1 75% correct, 1 50% correct, 5 wrong. That means five of these came partially true, but if we just add the values, we get 4.25, which means that I wasn't a golden prognosticator of Open Source for 2010.  However, on the bright side, at least I was able to test my predictions, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism">unlike Kurzweil</a>, right?</p>

<p>Coming soon I'll post my predictions for 2011.  I've learned a little from this analysis and hope to use that knowledge to make some better future predictions.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/13/what-qualifies-as-an-open-source-project/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-13T21:26:14-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/13/what-qualifies-as-an-open-source-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last few days at the <a href="http://foss2010.isr.uci.edu/">FOSS2010 Workshop</a> in Irvine, CA.  It's an interesting little workshop that brought together some of the best minds in Open Source research from academia, industry, and practice.  The goal was to develop a roadmap for the future of Open Source research.</p>

<p>One issue that constantly comes up is how many Open Source projects exist.  People most often point to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> as an indicator of success, with it's claim on 230,000 projects and more than 2 million users.  However, how many of those are really projects.</p>

<p>First, lets look at activity on SourceForge.  It's about halfway through the day on Saturday, and according to the home page here's a summary of Today's activity:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile>	<figure class='center'>
		<img src="/media/2010/02/SourceForgeDailyStats.png">
		<figcaption>Activity as of Noon PST on a Saturday </figcaption>
	</figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>If there are actually 230,000 active projects this amount is laughable.  I'll be generous and say that bug tracking activity is less on a Saturday, so we assume that the 12 hours of data represent 1/1,000 of yearly activity, we're getting less than three bugs per project a year.</p>

<p>I polled some of the other folks at the workshop for a definition of a project and I think we've gotten a pretty good idea. First, there is a selection of general project process attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code available under an Open Source license</li>
<li>Publicly accessible web page, bug trackers, mailings lists, and version control</li>
<li>Governance model that allows outside contribution</li>
</ul>


<p>The license is actually the only item that is necessary to call a project Open Source, while publicly accessible collaboration resources and a governance model that allows for participation are conditions that are required for any sort of community to emerge.  However, under these terms it still is possible to have a project that is run by a single person and isn't really open.  I can still create a project, release it under an Open Source license, register it on SourceForge, and say I accept contributions, but it won't really be Open Source in most people's definition of the words.</p>

<p>After talking to various other quite intelligent people within the community I'd like to propose the following criteria for calling a project truly Open Source:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least three different contributors</li>
<li>Code that can be compiled and run by someone with only moderate skill in the field and without significant external resources</li>
<li>A social process that not only allows contribution, but actively mentors new developers</li>
<li>Active participation by individuals who write no code</li>
</ul>


<p>I'll go over each of these criteria and explain why they're necessary for a first cut of determining whether or not a project is truly Open Source.</p>

<p>One of the key elements of Open Source development is that it is a collaborative effort by multiple developers.  Advantages include utilizing the expertise of each of the different developers and having many developers looking over the code to ensure to identify bugs.  If a project is just one or two people then it is unlikely that there is always enough overlap of individuals examining code.  Furthermore, it's unlikely that the strategy process for designing and developing new features needs to be collaborative at all.  Fortunately, this is something that can be easily ascertained through automated methods when mining software communities.</p>

<p>The next requirement is that the project actually be able to compile by people of moderate skill in the field.  This is important because not everyone in the field of interest is going to be an expert.  If you require everyone to be an expert then the community will have trouble growing.  Requiring expensive libraries or exotic compilers has a similar effect and dramatically limits the pool of individuals.  It also may signify that the community really isn't interested in harness the resources of an open community.  This raises some interesting questions about existing projects, for example, VISTA is a widely used system for managing hospital infrastructure from the Veterans Administration of the United States, but it written in MUMPS, a language that few people know and with even fewer compilers (I'm aware that in the strictest sense VISTA isn't Open Source anyway, as the core is public domain, but we'll ignore that for now).  How does this compare to open source code designed to run on Oracle's high end databases?  I don't have a clear answer, but when weighing projects it's something to be aware of.</p>

<p>Next up is a social process that mentors new developers.  Sadly this is one place where many Open Source projects end up falling flat.  For example, GLIBC under the iron hand of Ulrich Drepper fails this category.  When dealing with potential future developers, it's necessary to actively ensure they learn the process.  This includes simple things such as helping developers understand the process roadmap, explaining why bugs are rejected or marked as dupes, and responding to users on mailing lists in a gentle manner.  Now clearly, at some point projects need to put some of the impetus for learning on the potential community members or we'll end up with hundreds of Bowie J. Poags, but I'd imagine for every Bowie you'll get a couple of genuinely helpful developers.</p>

<p>The final issue is obtaining contributions from individuals who don't write code.  For a long time there has been a perception that the code is all that really matters.  This was reinforced through some early writing such as the Cathedral and the Bazaar and misinterpretations of Lessig's Code.  The most successful projects all have numerous individuals who write no code, instead they write documentation, create art, support users on the mailing lists and chat channels, and act as general promoters of the software across all media. The fact of the matter is that although I know many skilled coders who may excel in some of these additional areas, they can't do it all alone.  Without these other individuals, you don't really have an Open Source project.</p>

<p>I don't claim that these criteria are perfect for identifying "true" Open Source projects, but they do help to ensure that projects at least have some of the key elements of what is generally considered to be Open Source and have a chance of being successful. I also don't see this as competing with something like Tony Wasserman's <a href="http://www.openbrr.org/">Open BRR</a>, rather, for individuals researching Open Source they should be a guideline for identifying projects that will be interesting and exhibit the behaviors that make Open Source interesting to study in the first place.</p>
