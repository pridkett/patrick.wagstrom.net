While searching for information related to the INDUCE/IICA act on
<a href="http://www.congress.gov/">Thomas</a>, I began to wonder, why
not make a more flexible architecture for it.  Ideally I'd like to
see something like RSS Government, read on to see what I mean.

<p>
RSS Government (or Atom Government, for those of that persuasion) would
provide a method to subscribe to RSS feeds about action in the house and
senate.  Not only would it allow you to subscribe to the overall feed, but
also for a particular bill.  Each night, a program would go out and crawl
<a href="http://www.congress.gov/">Thomas</a> for any new information and
then update the feeds.
</p>
<p>
After downloading the data, it would then parse the data to figure out what
was discussed and create the appropriate feeds.  Thus I could just add in
the feed on IICA into <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/straw/">Straw</a> and I
would never have to worry about being out of date.  One can also think of
other interesting things, like providing a feed about any votes taken in 
congress, etc.  If I only I never needed to sleep, I could get so much more
done.
