Back at [IIT](http://www.iit.edu/) I started an [IPRO](http://ipro.iit.edu/)
on pervasive computing under the direction of [Dr. Xian-He Sun](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~sun/).
The project started out as pervasive solutions for classroom use, but eventually morphed into a
cool project called [HawkTour](http://www.hawktour.net/).
It was pretty hard to leave this work because it was a lot of fun and we were creating interesting
new uses of technology.  Well, after I left, they continued in the vision that was laid out with some
of my ideas and lots of AMAZING work by [Tyler Butler](http://www.tylerbutler.com/) and
created a cool pervasive computing application that lets you know what is going on in your area
while taking a campus tour.  A few days they got some
[great press from the Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/10/10/location_tracking____for_people_products_places____is_fast_coming_into_its_own/).  This makes me really happy.  Congrats to the folks who are working on this.  It's
nice to see projects you started on grow up.
