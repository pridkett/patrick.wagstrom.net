Our First Christmas Tree

<p>
With marriage comes a lot of "firsts".  We're making a bit of an effort to
document some of these firsts so we can remember them for later.  On Friday,
the day after thanksgiving, Kristina and I put up our Christmas Tree.  I 
purchased it last year on the day after Christmas for about $15 or so.  We've
got a whole series of photos that will eventually go up when I finish my 
<a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">photo gallery software</a>.  But for right
now, you get to see the before and after pictures of our tree.
