I've had my MGA G400-MAX dual head video card since I built my current desktop
computer back in April of 2000.  I've used the second head for xinerama and dual
monitor work in the past, it always worked pretty nicely.  I sold the second
monitor last year after I got my laptop.  I figured I might as well get the
second head to output on the TV.

Using the drivers provided by Matrox I was able to get the second head to
output to the TV, but I couldn't get XV accelerated video.  This left me
very sad as it meant that I there wasn't any chance of me getting
[MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) running on the TV.  Well, today
I finally fixed that problem.  Yay!

I utilized the nice
[G400 TVOut HowTo](http://davedina.apestaart.org/download/doc/Matrox-TVOUT-HOWTO-0.1.txt)
from [Thomasvs](http://thomas.apestaart.org/) to get going.
Amazingly, almost everything was easily installed from apt.  The
kernel already had all of the modules compiled, so that was no
problem.  fbset was installed via apt.  I needed to go visit the
[debian matroxset packages](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/matroxset).
On [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.com/) these installed without any
problem.

The next thing I did was to make the system load the appropriate modules
at run time.  So I added the following lines to my
`/etc/modules` file, which autoloads modules at
system boot time.


        # needed for doing TVOut
        mga
        i2c_matroxfb
        matroxfb_crtc2
        matroxfb_maven


The next step was to create a startup script.  I've pasted that below.  Save
this as `/etc/init.d/matroxTVOut`.

    :::bash
    #!/bin/sh
    
    . /lib/lsb/init-functions
    . /etc/default/rcS
    
    MATROXSET=/usr/bin/matroxset
    FBSET=/usr/sbin/fbset
    FBDEV=/dev/fb0
    FBDEV2=/dev/fb1
    
    # test to ensure that the proper tools are present
    echo "Testing for matrox set"
    test -f $MATROXSET || exit 0
    echo "Testing for fbset"
    test -f $FBSET || exit 0
    echo "Testing for fbdev"
    test -c $FBDEV || exit 0
    echo "everything seems to be present"
    
    case "$1" in
            start)
                    log_begin_msg "Initializing Matrox TV out..."
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV -m 0
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV -m 3
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV -o 1 2
                    $FBSET -fb $FBDEV -xres 800 -yres 600
                    $FBSET -fb $FBDEV -left 54 -right 26 -lower 32 -upper 80 -hslen 40
                    log_end_msg $?
                    ;;
            stop)
                    log_begin_msg "Stopping Matrox TV out..."
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV -m 0
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV2 -m 0
                    $MATROXSET -f $FBDEV -m 1
                    $FBSET -fb $FBDEV -left 0 -right 0 -lower 0 -upper 0
                    log_end_msg $?
                    ;;
            *)
                    log_success_msg "Usage: matroxTVOut {start|stop}"
                    exit 1
                    ;;
    esac


And you'll need to add this your default startup scripts using
`update-rc.d`.  We're almost there, the final step is to setup X11 so we
can run it on the framebuffer device.  The default Ubuntu setup is
basically right, but we need to make some changes.  We need to change
the device setting.


    Section "Device"
            Identifier      "Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP"
            Driver          "mga"
            BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
            Option          "hw cursor" "off"
            Option          "UseFBDev" "on"
    EndSection


And the last little touch is to setup the output resolution in X11.
This little snippet should take care of it for you.


    Section "Screen"
            Identifier      "Default Screen"
            Device          "Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP"
            Monitor         "AccuSync 95F"
            DefaultDepth    16
            DefaultFbBPP    16
            SubSection "Display"
                    Depth 16
                    Modes "800x600"
            EndSubSection
    EndSection


And voila.  We should have everything setup to make X11 run at 800x600
mode with output on both the monitor and the TV.  You'll want to look
at Thomasvs'
