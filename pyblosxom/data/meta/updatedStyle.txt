Updated Style

I went through and decided to give my weblog a facelift.  Originally I had
intended it to be much more exhaustive, but I settled on something pretty
simple for right now.  I'd still like to add the ability to leave comments
at some point in the near future.  However, it always comes down to this
issue of updating my Pyblosxom software, which is so incredibly branched
from old school version 0.8, or writing new software.

Anyway, if you've got comments on the new style, email them to me.  I'll
add the ability for comments in the future.
