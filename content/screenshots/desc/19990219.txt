See, I do have to use windows once in a while.  Although I don't really
like having to.  You can see what my desktop looks like.  As you may
notice, I still use borland c++ 3.1 for do, because vc++ blows.  I also
have my copy of Max+Plus II open because I was working on lab at the
time.  (Max+Plus II is a hardware design tool)
