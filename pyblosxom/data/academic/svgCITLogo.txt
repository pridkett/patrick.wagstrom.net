CIT Logo In SVG

I'm sorta on a mission.  I really need some graphics to brand my presentations
and stuff, but most are of hideous resolution or in non-editable format.  With
that being said, my new hack today is the <a href="http://www.cit.cmu.edu/">College of Engineering</a> logo for
<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>.

<object data="/resources/images/blog/CITblack.svgz" style="width: 276pt; height: 104pt;" type="image/svg+xml"/>
<br/>
<object data="/resources/images/blog/CITblue.svgz" style="width: 276pt; height: 104pt;" type="image/svg+xml"/>
<p>
For some reason, my SVG viewer doesn't like always displaying these, but I
assure that you can mangle them all you'd like in your favorite SVG editor.
If you'd like to download them, here is the <a href="/resources/images/blog/CITblack.svgz">black logo</a> and here is the <a href="/resources/images/blog/CITblue.svgz">blue logo</a>.
