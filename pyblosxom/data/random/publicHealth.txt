Scary Public Health Stuff

My Uber-Intelligent office and stat/public health loving officemate Sarah sent
me a wonderful
<a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ps/cdic/cdcb/pds/cpe/Documents/090904Handout.pdf">set of public health slides from California</a>.  Apparently, this briefing
was used for the Governator to convince him that California needed to stop
"Dumb growth" and be more intelligent about creating communities.  It touches
on a lot of issues, such as community design, exercise, and walking to school
and has some good graphs in it.  I've taken the liberty of using some
ImageMagick Ninja-Foo to convert the set of slides on obesity to trends to
a nice animated gif, which you can see below.  The moral is that apparently
all the hard bodies live in Colorado, while every place else in America
is populated by fatasses.  Yay for Mississippi.

On a side note, if anyone knows how to get ImageMagick to generate a flash
image that would be nice.  Animated Gifs really are teh suck.  I can't wait
for <a href="http://www.vlad1.com/~vladimir/projects/apng/">APNG</a> to get
into the main branch of FireFox and ImageMagick.  In the mean time, here is
the command line I used to make these.  A little quality time with the GIMP was
spent afterwards to ensure that maps were all about the same size.
