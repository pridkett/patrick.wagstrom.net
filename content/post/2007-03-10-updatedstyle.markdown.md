I went through and decided to give my weblog a facelift.  Originally I had intended it to be much more exhaustive, but I settled on something pretty simple for right now.  I'd still like to add the ability to leave comments at some point in the near future.  However, it always comes down to this issue of updating my Pyblosxom software, which is so incredibly branched from old school version 0.8, or writing new software.

Anyway, if you've got comments on the new style, email them to me.  I'll add the ability for comments in the future.
