This marks my fourth attempt at being a technology pundit after
previous attempts in [2010][2010pred], [2011][2011pred], and [2012][2012pred]. I honestly have no idea
what happened to my 2013 predictions or if I ever made them. As usual,
these predictions are intended to be concrete and testable, rather
than vague things like "the singularity happens" without providing a
definition of the Singularity.

* **America finally sees chip and pin credit cards**

It's no longer a rarity to find a credit card with a chip on it, but
they're almost always chip and signature cards. While the chip
provides additional security as the actual credit card number is never
sent, merely a cryptographic challenge/response, the signature still
is easily forged and often ignored.

The [Target data breach][targetbreach] in November and December 2013
showed just how fragile and insecure our credit card system is. Within
days of the breach [banks were buying their own credit card numbers
from black market sites][banksbuying] to notify their customers. Banks
are proactively issuing new cards to customers, but this leaves them
open for the next massive security fault. A shift to chip and pin
would make the system massively safer - but this requires
infrastructure changes. Expect to see this happen quickly at least one
major bank will announce that fradulent charges as a result of
magnetic stripe scans for cards that have a chip will be borne by the
vendor, not the bank. This will cause uproar, but it needs to happen.

* **Hulu is bought by HBO or Verizon**

Hulu has been trying to sell itself for a couple of years. It's always
on-again and off-again. While Hulu is attempting to move forward with
original series, it's not having the same luck that Netflix has had
with its high profile series (e.g. "House of Cards", "Arrested
Development", and "Orange is the New Black"). This is partially
because of a vision problem, and partially because Hulu currently
lacks access to fine grained customer data that Netflix
has. Fortunately for Hulu's financial state, but HBO and Verizon are
looking to expand in this area. HBO is looking to fend off challenges
from Netflix and, while it has continually produced high quality
series, it may be struggling and access to the data behind Hulu would
bolster HBOs demographic knowledge. HBO provided content would also
give Hulu a much needed shot in the arm and provide a HBO a lifeline
beyond the slowly dying medium of cable television.

In contrast, Verizon is facing challenges from Comcast as it attempts
to become a communication and data hub. Verizon has tried to launch
their own television networks and distribution, but their streaming
platform is still rather poor. Acquistion of Hulu would give Verizon a
high quality streaming platform, in roads into Comcast customers, and
also a nascent studio that develops content.

There's an outside chance Amazon could purchase Hulu - it would be a
great expansion of Amazon Prime. However, I think that if Jeff Bezos
wanted Hulu under the Amazon banner it would have happened
already. This most likely means tat Amazon has big plans for whatever
will become of Amazon Prime Video as Bezos doesn't play small. How
exactly Bezos intends to notify his
[20 million+ Amazon Prime][azprime] customers that he has high quality
video streaming remains a bit of a mystery.

* **SteamOS will finally drive the year of the Linux Desktop**

Although Linux has been successful for years as a server platform, the
joke among supporters of the Linux desktop has always been "next year
will be the year of the Linux desktop". Valve's work on
[SteamOS][steamOS] will finally make that a sort of reality. Gabe
Newell has been vocal about migrating away from Windows because the
mess that is Windows 8, and it appears that developers are becoming
increasingly frustrated. Steam for Linux has already made it possible
to play hundreds of games on Linux with no additional effort - expect
to see this number continue to grow in 2014. These games will prove a
necessary component as Valve goes head to head against Microsoft and
Sony for control of the living room. Along the way Valve will pick up
something that Linux users have longed for - support for Netflix.

* **Dual operating systems will land with a resounding thud**

Continuing with discussion of the woes of Windows 8 - we're hearing
that [many vendors plan on announcing dual platform tablets at
CES][dualtablets]. I'm going down right now and saying that this is a stupid idea
that will fail in the marketplace. End users don't want to think about
having to reboot a tablet to switch between Android and Windows. They
just want it to work. The added cost of the dual platform tablets,
combined with the fact that I'm certain they'll have uniformly
terrible user experiences and build qualities, ensures that this is an
idea that is dead on arrival.

* **Microsoft merges Windows Phone and Windows RT**

Recently [Microsoft has been running commercials describing the one
consistent interface across all their devices - phones, tablets, and
desktops][mscommercial]. The problem is that people not only want one interface, they
want one system. Apple and Google did the right thing by not creating
a new operating system when they created tablets (although, if we're
splitting hairs, one might say that Android Honeycomb was a new
operating system). People want to have their apps at their fingertips
- and this means that they either have the phone operating system on
the tablet or the desktop operating system on the tablet. Microsoft
attempted to have it both ways with Windows RT.

* **Snowden will get asylum in Brazil or Germany**

Greenwald has hinted that only a small portion of the overall trove of
Snowden documents has been released. Both countries have acted as
though they've been surprised about the revelations that the United
States was spying on them, although the reality is that their security
apparatus should be gutted wholesale if they didn't already know
this. Nonetheless, while most of these revelations won't do anything
to change the behind the scenes action, politicians in both countries
will seek to strike a "special" deal with Snowden that at least gives
them the perception of getting inside information on the spying scandal.

* **A major cloud provider will suffer a data breach exposing data on
  VMs to other customers**
  
This is one that we haven't heard much about yet, but I'd imagine
we'll see more about it this year. Many companies, both larget and
small, are moving their operations to shared cloud hosting
environments such as a Amazon EC2, SoftLayer, and RackSpace. Racently
it was found that [Digital Ocean, a smaller hosting service, had a flaw
in their systems that didn't securely delete VMs][digitaloceanproblems]. This
lead to the possibility that someone could see the data of other
customers. Fortunately, it seems as though this was relatively
innocuous, but given the potential for problems here, I'd say that
this is the first of many such problems we'll hear about in the future.

* **At least one Silicon Valley "luminary" will lose his job because of
  comments made about women in tech**

There recently was a bit of brouhaha regarding comments that Paul
Graham made about women and innovation. Although, [according to Paul
Graham, his comments were taken out of context][wids]. Nevertheless,
the whole firestorm was oddly reminiscent of [Donglegate][donglegate]
and it's clear this is still a really touchy issue - and for good
reason. Given the fact that not all tech luminaries are as socially
smart as they are technologically smart, it's only a matter of time
until one of them says something **really** stupid that will be taken
even more out of context than Paul Graham's comments.

* **An automobile manufacturer will suffer a major security breach in
  the software installed on their vehicles**

More and more it seems as though the software in automobiles is the
differntiating factor between brands and even within the brands. While
software had a simple start in cars, it's not unheard of for cars such
as the [Chevy Volt to
have 10 million lines of code][voltinfo] that encompasses software with
[dozens of different licenses][mblicenses]. Unfortunately, building
good software is hard. Building secure software is even harder. The
remote access through apps, such as the
[OnStar Remote Link App][onstarapp], provide numerous new attack
vectors. It doesn't take a genius to see where this going.

* **A major credit card data breach will lead to legislation that shifts
  the onus of credit repair from the consumer to the vendor that
  leaked the data**

Right now if your credit card information is stolen through vendor,
you're not responsible for the charges, but you are responsible for
cleaning up any mess on your credit report that may result. Quite
frankly, this is a massive abdication of responsibility and I think
that once we see a large scale data breach that gets enough people
really angry (it could be Target), we'll see legislation that finally
asks the folks who suffered the data breach to bear the costs for
fixing it. This goes beyond the usual and useless "1 year of free
credit monitoring".

* **The house and the senate will remain largely status quo**

I don't think this needs any dramatic explanation. The house is rigged
enough that there are few competitive districts. The senate will
remain in democratic hands not because the democrats will run a set of
great campaigns, but more because the republicans insist on nominating
crazy people.

What are your thoughts about these predictions? Have I started to go
too easy? Should I go back to focusing almost exclusively on open
source? Do you have predictions of your own that you'd like to share?
