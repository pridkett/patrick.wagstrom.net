BibTeXML Editor

This weekend I've been learning how to do GUI programming in Python with PyGTK.
I've been working on an editor for BibTeXML so you don't always need to type all
the fields by hand.  This is what I've got going so far:

It's only the people editing that works right now, and even that isn't 100% yet, still
a few tweaks required like auto updating the list of people to the right and being
able to add people to the file.  But the nifty thing is that XML is generated as
you go, which is pretty cool.  I just wish that someone (read: NOT ME) cranked out
a custom widget for GTK that was an XML viewing widget, preferably linked with libxml2
or something like that.  I'm sure I could do it in python, but I don't want to take
the time now.
