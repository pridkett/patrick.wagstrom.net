  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently I&#8217;ve got problems when using the WCF12 and the Zaurus.  At first I thought that it was just my problem, but another person seems to have the same problem.  After inserting the card, about 5 minutes later it will just magically stop working.  If we reinsert the card the network works again.  It seems to work fine in ad-hoc mode, and I can run Kismet for an indefinite period of time without any problems, but using IP with a WAP seems to cause some problems.  If anyone has some help, I would appreciate it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So rather than utilize a junk windows PC for my computer for research, I have been allocated a SunBlade 100, not a bad computer at all.  The problem is that I need USB network device driver support for it.  Solaris doesn&#8217;t cut it.  So I figured that I would install Linux on it.  The natural choice, at least for me, was Gentoo.  It seems like a nice enough distribution.  I like the entirely from source totally-up-to-date aspect of it.  But it doesn&#8217;t seem to be going that well.</p>

<p>First I had to fight with the install program.  I had some big time problems with mounting the proc file system.  I think I have it now, but I&#8217;m still not all that sure.  Then I had to wait while it compiled everything.  I can handle all of that.  Then I installed SILO but must have horked it, because it didn&#8217;t work.  The bootable CD saved me.  Then I realized that I hadn&#8217;t installed the /usr to the partition that /usr was supossed to be on.  This killed me.  It horked both my /usr and my / partitions.  So it&#8217;s back to square one with Gentoo on my blade.  Oh well&#8230;keep on trucking&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s a good thing that I live in the ghetto where not that many people have computers.  I doubt that anyone above or below me has a wireless keyboard.  My neighbors are old folks who probably don&#8217;t have a computer.  But in Norway, well there you could be <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=474623">using the same keyboard as your neighbor</a> and it might take a while to find out.  Well, not the same keyboard, but you would get interference.  This seems a little odd, I had my computer over at my brothers house, where he also has a Logitech wireless keyboard, and we had no problems there.  ::shrug::</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m glad that I started using the MySQL stuff for movable type.  I just wrote  snippet of code that selects the five most recent entries from my blog and produces links for them.  Here is the code (where it&#8217;s assumed $GLOBALS[&#8220;dbh&#8221;] is a handle to the <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> database handle):</p>

<pre><code>function mtLink($_entryId, $_entryTitle, $_entryDate) {
    echo "&amp;lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;a href=\"weblog/archives/";
    for ($i = (6 - strlen($_entryId)); $i &gt; 0; $i --) {
        echo "0";
    }
    echo $_entryId.".html\"&gt;".$_entryTitle."&amp;lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;br /&gt;\n";
    echo date("F j, Y, g:ia",$_entryDate)."&amp;lt;/li&gt;\n";
}

function latestWeblogs() {
    $dbh = $GLOBALS["dbh"];
    $stmt = "  SELECT entry_id, entry_title, unix_timestamp(entry_created_on)
                 FROM mt_entry
             ORDER BY entry_created_on desc
                LIMIT 5";
    $result = $dbh-&gt;query($stmt);
    while ($thisrow = $result-&gt;fetchRow(DB_FETCHMODE_ASSOC)) {
        mtLink($thisrow["entry_id"], $thisrow["entry_title"], $thisrow["unix_timestamp(entry_created_on)"]-3600*6);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The 3600*6 is to put everything in my timezone.  It&#8217;s not flaweless and may get stuff off by an hour or two, but works well enough.  This will, by default just print list items, so you&#8217;ll want to encase it in a &lt;ul> or  &gt;ol> or something like that.  You can see the results on the sides of most of my pages.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a long time I was a bit of a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> bigot.  I preferred to use <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> because it had some more advanced support built in for things like transactions.  Well, the conversion back to MySQL has been pretty nice.  I just found out about <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/mysqlcc/index.html">MySQL Control Center</a> which is a nifty GUI by the MySQL people for administering databases.  Although I know SQL, the GUI makes it easy to do simple things.  This is a blessing and probably will result in me using more database driven stuff in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure most people by now have heard of the evils of the <a href="http://www.riaa.org/">RIAA</a> and how Hillary Rosen is just plain misguided about technology.  Apparently at a conference in Cannes, France, Ms. Rosen <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=582&amp;e=3&amp;cid=582&amp;u=/nm/20030118/wr_nm/tech_internet_music_dc">suggested that there be a surcharge</a> for people who utilize peer to peer services.  This is impossible to enforce.  It would require an ISP to monitor every connection that is made and furthermore dig into the data.  Of course, <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> spun the story to make it sound as though Rosen was a fire-breathing hobgoblin who demanded the fee from all users, which isn&#8217;t what she said at all.  She said that if ISPs gave access they should pay up.  I still think a better idea is compulsory licensing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, after the fiasco with <a href="http://www.ecollege.com/">ecollege.com</a> I decided to look up how to change my browsers user-agent (I use <a href="http://galeon.sf.net/">galeon</a>).  Here is how you do it (take from the Galeon Faq):</p>

<ol>
<li>To get the current user agent type:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>gconftool -g /apps/galeon/Advanced/Network/user_agent
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>To set a user agent type:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>gconftool -s /apps/galeon/Advanced/Network/user_agent --type=string "XXX"
</code></pre>

<p>For example, to make the system think that you&#8217;re running IE 6.0 on WinXP do this:</p>

<pre><code>gconftool -s /apps/galeon/Advanced/Network/user_agent --type=string "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)"
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Finally, to restore the default type:</li>
</ol>


<pre><code>gconftool -s /apps/galeon/Advanced/Network/user_agent --type=string default
</code></pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so I tried to contact these people and the addresses bounced, go figure.  Here is the followup email that I just sent to their <a href="mailto:helpdesk@iit.ecollege.com">techsupport</a> and <a href="mailto:evaluation@iit.edu">evaluation@iit.edu</a>.</p>

<pre><code>This is a followup to a phone call I just had with your technical
support people.  The first issue is that of email addresses on this
page:

http://iit.ecollege.com/pubinclude/ErrMessaging.asp?Error_Type=13&amp;LTID=A&amp;ClientID=&amp;ClientString=&amp;URL=A%5FPSH%2Ereal&amp;browser=Netscape&amp;version=5

It tells me to email techsupport@realed.com, but this is the response
that I receive:

&gt; From: System Administrator &lt;postmaster@ecollege.com&gt;
&gt; To: patrick@dreams.wagstrom.net
&gt; Date: Fri, 22 Nov 2002 09:43:24 -0700
&gt; Subject: Undeliverable: Browser Support
&gt;
&gt; Your message

&gt;   Subject: Browser Support
&gt;   Sent:    Fri, 22 Nov 2002 09:43:39 -0700
&gt;
&gt; did not reach the following recipient(s):

&gt; Recipient

It's clear to see that the problem resides on your side, as it got to
postmaster@ecollege.com and then bounced.  Please fix this error as soon
as possible.

Secondly is the larger issue of browser support, here is the original
email that I tried to send to you regarding browser support.

&gt; Subject: Browser Support
&gt;
&gt; As a person who cares both about my personal security and the quality of
&gt; my software, I am more than a little surprised at your lack of support
&gt; for Mozilla based browsers on the IIT evaluation site.  Despite the fact
&gt; that it has been shown that Mozilla (the engine on which newer netscape
&gt; browsers are based) is the most robust and standards compliant web
&gt; browser available.  Even looking at the chart I am referred to at:
&gt;
&gt; http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/
&gt;
&gt; it inidicates that Mozilla 1.0 and 1.1 support all of the features that
&gt; would be required of an HTML page.  This leaves people who use Unix
&gt; based systems in a quandry.  Either downgrade their software, or use a
&gt; buggy commercial browser (see http://www.iit.edu/~wagspat/exploittest.html)
&gt; that has the possibility to execute code without my asking.
&gt;
&gt; I would like to know the reason for the lack of support for Mozilla
&gt; based browsers.
&gt;
&gt; Thank You,
&gt;
&gt; Patrick Wagstrom

The conversation that I had with your help desk representative was
moderately helpful, and he explained that you hadn't tested support for
anything beyond Netscape 4.x.  While I understand the need to QA
material, I also feel the need to inform you of the substantial minority
at technical Universities, such as IIT, that use Linux as their
operating system, and thus probably also use a Mozilla based browser.
Yet when I went to call technical support I was only given the option of
being a Mac or a Windows user.

Not daunted, and being secure in the fact that I run a standards
compliant browser, I hit the button on the afformentioned page, that
said try logging anywya.  Only to be presented with a 404/Not Found
error from your webserver as it attempts to access this page:

http://iit.ecollege.com/A_PSH.real?ClientID=577661&amp;ClientString=iit&amp;47wagspat

I'm finding this whole thing a little disturbing.

Also, why isn't such information encrypted over transit?  We are
transmitting personal information on the login page, yet it is not
secure.  This is more than a little disturbing.

I've attached the error page.  The graphics are broken on it when I look
at it on the server too, and the links for email addresses aren't mailto
links like they should be, instead they take me to yet another 404/Not
Found page.

I'm trying to be very patient here, but some of this seems to be just
outright negligence.  I've attached the page it gives me as an error.

Peace,

Patrick

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With telnet most people know you can hit ^] to escape back to the program, but most people don&#8217;t realize that you can do a similar thing with OpenSSH.  This is VERY helpful when your session dies.  In OpenSSH the escape key is the tilde.  Here is the segment from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">OpenSSH manual</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;b&gt;Escape Characters&lt;/b&gt;

     When a pseudo terminal has been requested, ssh supports a number of func-
     tions through the use of an escape character.

     A single tilde character can be sent as ~~ or by following the tilde by a
     character other than those described below.  The escape character must
     always follow a newline to be interpreted as special.  The escape charac-
     ter can be changed in configuration files using the EscapeChar configura-
     tion directive or on the command line by the -e option.

     The supported escapes (assuming the default `~') are:

     &lt;b&gt;~.&lt;/b&gt;      Disconnect

     &lt;b&gt;~^Z&lt;/b&gt;     Background ssh

     &lt;b&gt;~#&lt;/b&gt;      List forwarded connections

     &lt;b&gt;~&amp;&lt;/b&gt;      Background ssh at logout when waiting for forwarded connection /
             X11 sessions to terminate

     &lt;b&gt;~?&lt;/b&gt;      Display a list of escape characters

     &lt;b&gt;~C&lt;/b&gt;      Open command line (only useful for adding port forwardings using
             the -L and -R options)

    &lt;b&gt; ~R&lt;/b&gt;      Request rekeying of the connection (only useful for SSH protocol
             version 2 and if the peer supports it)
