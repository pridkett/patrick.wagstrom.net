  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="/weblog/weblog/web/tracks-behind-apache.xml">previous post on setting up Tracks and Ruby on Rails to run behind an Apache proxy</a>, there was a bit of symlink hokerey  hat one had to do to make it serve the static content properly.  What if we didn&#8217;t have to do that?  What if we could get by with only adding the line:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>    <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">AbstractRequest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">relative_url_root</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tracks&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To your ~/tracks/config/environment.rb file?  Wouldn&#8217;t that just be grand?  What if we could go beyond that and make Apache serve up all the static content?  It&#8217;s one less component to break while proxying requests back and forth.  Well, we can.</p>

<p>In additon to the ability of ProxyPass statements to direct requests to a remote proxy, they can also be used to deny certain URLs from a proxy.  That&#8217;s the technique that we&#8217;ll be using here.  Previously, the configuration section of interest
looked like this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='apache'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">RewriteEngine</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">RewriteRule</span> ^/tracks$ https://secure.wagstrom.net/tracks/ [R,L]
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPass</span> <span class="sx">/tracks/</span> http://127.0.0.1:3000/tracks/
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPassReverse</span> <span class="sx">/tracks/</span> http://127.0.0.1:3000/tracks/
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPreserveHost</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, we just add in some lines to Apache to let it know what URLs not to proxy and how to handle those urls.  Just change the section so it now appears as follows:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPreserveHost</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first four ProxyPass statements tell Apache not to proxy requests to /tracks/images, /tracks/stylesheets, /tracks/javascripts, and /tracks/favicon.ico.  The next six lines make it so Apache actually knows how to serve the static content.  You&#8217;ll obviously want to replace /home/patrick/tracks/public with wherever your location of the Tracks public data is.  Now, restart Apache and you should have Apache serving the static content and Rails serving the dynamic content.  Awesome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like most geeks, I suffer from a profound lack of an ability to get things done.  I&#8217;ve read a lot of the stuff on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43 folders</a> and even thought about trying a few, but never really got around to it.  Yes, I&#8217;m that bad at getting things done.  One of these days, I may actually buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/">David Allen&#8217;s book <em>Getting Things Done</em></a>.  But for right now, I look at the fact that I&#8217;d have to pay shipping on it from Amazon and I say no.</p>

<p>I feel good to know that I&#8217;m not alone. <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog/">Kenneth</a> also suffers from the same issues, at times it appears that Pridjano Enterprises is better at being a support group for slackers than it is at changing the world.  However, today, something different hit my radar.  <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/">Luis Villa</a>, GNOME bugmaster extraordinaire, and overall really helpful guy made a <a href="http://tieguy.org/blog/2006/07/27/from-trac-to-tracks-for-gtd/">weblog entry about switching form trac to tracks for GTD</a>.  I was intrigued.  I had never thought about using Trac to manage my GTD in the first place, I guess it could be used, but it wasn&#8217;t designed for such and application from the ground up, thus it had some rougher edges when used for GTD.  After some poking around, I saw that <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a> looked like a pretty cool webapp.  One problem, it runs on Ruby on Rails. Ouch.  I had managed to stay away from Ruby on rails for quite a long time, it was time to give in.</p>

<p>First of all, <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> is a lot like <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>.  From what I can tell, it&#8217;s about halfway between the two languages.  I don&#8217;t see any clear advantage to using it, other than it doesn&#8217;t enforce the spacing requirements of Python, which is the major complaint I hear from people who have never used Python. Rails is a model, view, container sorta setup for developing web applications. It&#8217;s supposed to be pretty cool and pretty slick to develop apps with.  If you haven&#8217;t seen the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts">15 minute weblog on Rails movie</a>, I highly recommend it.  Pretty slick.  However, like many of the other frameworks such as <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>, and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, the framework requires a specialized and dedicated web server.  Well, not exactly, but most everyone runs it like that.  It was either that, or run it using <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">FastCGI</a>, which I&#8217;m not about to touch.</p>

<p>So, now the issue is, if it requires it&#8217;s own personal web server, it probably doesn&#8217;t support encryption, right?  If I&#8217;m storing my task list on there and accessing it from a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/computing/wireless/">frequently sniffed unencrypted wireless network</a>, I certainly want  SSL/TLS encryption, which the <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a> that ships with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> probably doesn&#8217;t support (note: I haven&#8217;t 100% checked the previous statement for it&#8217;s truthiness). I knew that I could easily do some proxying, after all, I currently have my installation of <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/MythWeb">MythWeb</a> running behind such a proxy with little difficulty.  So this shouldn&#8217;t be hard.</p>

<p>The first step was installing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/">Ruby-Gems</a> onto my <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> server.  Ruby is already in ports so it was a simple matter of running cd /usr/ports/lang/ruby &amp;&amp; FLAVOR=no_x11 sudo make install and waiting a little bit as Ruby was compiled for my system.  The next step was to build the <a href="http://www.rubygems.org/">Ruby Gems</a> package. Unfortunately, this package does not ship with a port in OpenBSD, but you can find one online at <a href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2006-01/0710.html">this link</a>, download it and untar it in /usr/ports/devel then run cd /usr/ports/devel/ruby-gems &amp;&amp; sudo make install to build the Ruby Gems package.</p>

<p>At this point you can install all sorts of Ruby packages with little difficulty, but we&#8217;re going to need to stay in the ports tree for a little bit longer.  If do not yet have sqlite3 installed, do that now.  While it&#8217;s possible to run Rails applications with any database, I chose SQLite because I don&#8217;t feel like setting up a full blown MySQL or PostgreSQL database on my web server.  So, run the command cd /usr/ports/databases/sqlite3 &amp;&amp; sudo make install, to build the libraries necessary for SQLite3, the preferred database for this little tutorial.  Finally, you&#8217;ll need to use the Ruby Gems package to install the SQLite3 bindings for Ruby, and <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>, which is Ruby&#8217;s version of the venerable <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> software.  Installing software packages with Ruby Gems is pretty quick.  Just run these two commands to install both Rake and the SQLite3-ruby bindings.  If you&#8217;re presented with multiple choices, just take the newest version. sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby, sudo gem install rake.  Finally, at this point you should all of the prerequisites installed for running Tracks on your system.</p>

<p>The next step is to download Tracks and unpack it.  I recommend creating a generic symlink to make the path something like ~/tracks instead of ~/tracks-1.041. It&#8217;s much cleaner and easier to understand.  I&#8217;ll also assume that you&#8217;ve followed the <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/manual/index">default installation instructions</a> and been able to get it running at http://0.0.0.0:3000/, as specified in the documentation.  Now, we&#8217;ve gotta have some fun and change a few things around.  The reason we need to move stuff around is because Rails expects to be at the root of the directory tree, and not somewhere else, we&#8217;re going to shoehorn it.  Start by adding the following line to ~/tracks/config/environment.rb.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="no">ActionController</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">AbstractRequest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">relative_url_root</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tracks&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This tells Rails that it&#8217;s not at the root of the directory hierarchy anymore. Now, we need to correct a small problem with the static content.  There probably is a more appropriate way to do this, but I&#8217;ve found my method works quite nicely.  Just run these commands:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">cd</span> ~/tracks/public
</span><span class='line'>    mkdir tracks
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">cd </span>tracks
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">for </span>x in images javascripts stylesheets; <span class="k">do </span>ln -s ../<span class="nv">$x</span> <span class="nv">$x</span>; <span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These commands fix some of the static content issues.  If you restart your Tracks installation, you should now need to access it using the /tracks url (i.e. http://0.0.0.0:3000/tracks).  The final step is to let Apache know it&#8217;s supposed to forward requests through to your Tracks installation.  Within OpenBSD, I have a file called /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf, which was previously configured as my secure server.  Now, just add the following line to that file:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='apache'><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">Include</span> conf/extra/tracks.conf
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And now create the file /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/tracks.conf, and put the following content in it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='apache'><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">RewriteEngine</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">RewriteRule</span> ^/tracks$ https://secure.wagstrom.net/tracks/ [R,L]
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPass</span> <span class="sx">/tracks/</span> http://127.0.0.1:3000/tracks/
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPassReverse</span> <span class="sx">/tracks/</span> http://127.0.0.1:3000/tracks/
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">ProxyPreserveHost</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first two lines help with some URL fixing in case someone forgets the trailing / at the end of the url.  The next lines tell it to proxy all requests for /tracks/ through to the special Rails instance of Lighttpd that&#8217;s running.  After restarting your apache instance and starting your Tracks server, you should now be able to access your installation of Tracks through your secure server.</p>

<p>I should make it perfectly clear, I know basically nothing about Rails or Ruby, and frankly, there are some portions of the Apache proxy stuff I&#8217;m not 100% on either.  But, I can say, this works quite well for me and provides easy access to my Tracks installation on my secure server.  I&#8217;m not sure if there is an easier way to change where the file locations are, or if there is a way to avoid making the symlinks in ~/tracks/public, if there is, I&#8217;d love to hear it.  My major comment is that this whole process was much more difficult to figure out than it should have been.  You&#8217;d think that with all the blabbering from the <a href="http://store.muledesign.com/shirts/koolaid.php">Web 2.0 kids</a> this process would easier than that, with better documentation.  It took me quite some time of scouring the web to figure this out, here&#8217;s hoping that I get some Blogosphere loving and this post can save you time in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, more than <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/code/gallery/start.xml">two years after I started work on a gallery program</a>, I finally have something that is workable and presentable.  No, I did not spend the last two years working on this software.  In fact, it&#8217;s been almost entirely written since I got back from Honduras and realized that I had 900 or so photos that I would like to share.</p>

<p>The original <a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">PennAve</a> was python based and used <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">the Python Imaging Library</a> for resizing the elements.  It also had some cool features like showing just a subsection of a picture, dynamic resizing to any size, and that sort of stuff.  Eventually it was supposed to go all multiuser and what not.  Then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> exploded and it didn&#8217;t seem like such a novel idea anymore.</p>

<p>So I had to think about a new way to do stuff.  I started using <a href="http://www.f-spot.org/">f-spot</a> to manage my photos.  I like the fact it allows me to create multiple versions of a photo with ease and the great integration of tagging into it.  It makes a nice slide show too.  From F-Spot I can export the data to a whole bunch of different systems, none of which I was a real fan of.  I wanted something that would let me use the F-Spot data without needing to use some other hokey system.  I figured this would bring us one step closer to world dominance.  Then I revisited <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2005/Nov-27-1.html">Miguel de Icaza&#8217;s writing about the Web Desktop</a> and figured this would be a cool starting point.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it&#8217;s not quite what Miguel envisioned. He talked about going all out and making it as an integrated part of the desktop.  Of course, he envisioned using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono libraries</a>.  While I don&#8217;t have a problem with C#, I realize that my server runs <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and I&#8217;m not eager to get Mono on there.  Also, there is no desktop on my server, so integrating it into F-spot was also a no go. The solution?  Whip up a little fun with <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>, and <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>.  A bit more fun with <a href="http://www.libxml.org/">libXML</a> and things seemed quite nice.  So now, I present for folks to take a gander at, <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">my PennAve demo site</a>.  If this seems to continue working well, then I&#8217;ll put the source up for a nice release sometime soon.  In the mean time, leave me some feedback on it.  If you&#8217;d like to just browse two major topics, look at <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/tags/15">Bellefield&#8217;s Honduras mission photos</a> and photos from <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/tags/667">our Niagara Falls anniversary trip</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I <a href="/weblog/weblog/politics/election/election-judge.xml">served as an election judge for Allegheny County</a>.  Today, four weeks after that election, the <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06164/697771-103.stm">results have finally been certified</a>.  I&#8217;m a little worried that they claim they were finding misplaced ballots, but it&#8217;s not that surprising, all things considered.</p>

<p>I had quite a few people raise concerns about the election while I was serving as judge, and I informed all those people that I would forward their concerns to the board of elections.  Shortly after the election I mailed a letter with these concerns and my own observations of the process and how to streamline the process some.  It&#8217;s been three weeks now, and I still haven&#8217;t received even a phone call.  What&#8217;s a guy to do?  Post the letter in his blog.  Yes, fellow citizens of Allegheny County, someone is trying to do stuff about this &#8211; however, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if anything happens as a result of this.</p>

<blockquote><p>Division of Elections<br/>Allegheny County<br/>542 Forbes Ave., Room 609<br/>Pittsburgh, PA 15219-2953</p><p>Dear Sir or Madam:</p><p>On May 16th, 2006 I had the privilege to serve as an election judge for the primary election in the 14th ward, 26th district of Pittsburgh.  It was my first time serving on election day, which made things very interesting.  Overall, the experience was very positive. The rest of the election board was very skilled, hard working, and most importantly, experienced.  Thanks to their hard work, we had almost no issues for our district.  The few voter issues we did have were resolved in fairly short order.  However, it is likely that the only reason we had the time to resolve these issues was because of the very low voter turnout, during the November election, which will see much higher turnout, we may not be able to adequately address all the voter needs.</p><p>In particular, there are some issues that I would be negligent if I did not address before the November election.  One of the largest issues is the lack of a paper trail related to the ballots.  I volunteered to serve as a judge because I wanted insight into how these machines worked and how the voters used the machines and what their reactions were.  During the day, I kept a tally of the voters who asked questions about the machines and their lack of a paper trail.  Of the 143 voters at our district, 12 raised concerns about the lack of a paper trail from the voting machines.  Each of these people raised their concerns without my prompting.  In particular, one voter wanted to cast a paper ballot to show her opposition to the current voting machines.  When I explained that she would most likely be the only person to vote on paper that day, and that as a result, her vote would not be at all anonymous, she expressed grave concern and said she was &#8220;stuck between a rock and a hard place&#8221;.  She agreed to vote using the iVotronic machines only after I assured that I would forward her issues to the department of elections.</p><p>Many of these voters, eight to be precise, were aware of the issues with lever voting machines and their inaccuracies and lack of a true paper trail.  However, they were concerned that with the lever machines small inaccuracies were common, but with the iVotronic machines, a large scale attack could possibly be launched.  One voter, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, was concerned that although we posted a zero tape on the wall, it was trivially easy to write a program that would print out zeroes next to each candidates name at the start of the morning.  He also expressed the opinion that a similar program could be created to print the final tapes at the end of the night.  If combined with machine tampering, it would be impossible to know if the will of the people was followed or not. Four of these voters expressed the opinion that voting with optical scan ballots might be better.  I took a chance to explain to these people some of the problems with optical scan ballots, in particular, the exploit from Harry Hursti that allows for placing negative votes for a candidate.  Only one of these voters correctly realized that the Hursti exploit relies on AccuBasic, a feature only present on Diebold machines.</p><p>I also took a chance to explain to each of the voters who asked about the lack of a voter verifiable paper audit trail on the electronic voting machines why under the current set of laws we cannot have a paper trail in Pennsylvania.  Namely that the current offering from ES&S produces a sequential roll of paper from which we could derive the votes of each voter.  A few asked why they couldn&#8217;t have a stub to take home, and I explained the issue with vote selling.  One voter correctly surmised that if ES&S iVotronic machines were able to cut off each stub of paper and drop it into a box, that this would satisfy the requirements for the commonwealth.  Given the size of the contract from Allegheny county, it is my belief that the county would be well served in pressing ES&S for such a device.  If this is not possible, it would be nice to have information for voters regarding the requirements of voting machines in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a brief explanation of the security measures of the iVotronic voting machines.  I strongly believe that the addition of a paper trail will be bring confidence to the electoral process, however, if that is not possible, a better explanation would help significantly. The other people on the election board in my district were unaware of the controversy regarding the electronic voting machines.</p><p>While the paper trail was the largest issue raised by voters, there were a handful of other issues that should be addressed.  Firstly, while the machines are a step forward in terms of accessibility from the old lever machines, they lack a consistent user interface.  In particular, the shift from having to use the touch screen to the vote button and back to the touch screen confused many voters.  After about ten voters had been processed at our district, we began to give a brief tutorial to the voter about how to use the machine when we brought up their ballot.  Many people indicated this was very helpful, however we&#8217;re not sure how well it will work in November when we are much busier and cannot take an additional minute to explain the usage of the machine.  Another common complaint about the user interface was that it was inconsistent about how to move around.  In particular, we had numerous voters request assistance after getting to the end of page two of the ballot and not remember they needed to press &#8220;review&#8221; to continue with the process.  Perhaps a smaller set of instructions that can be taped inside the &#8220;wings&#8221; of the voting machine would be helpful for explaining how to do common tasks on the machine.</p><p>Within our district we had several voters who had poor vision &#8211; each of these individuals was offered the ability to use an audio ballot instead of the visual ballot, however none took advantage of this.  I&#8217;m not 100% sure why this is, but one voter in particular indicated he would feel &#8220;strange&#8221; doing that.  This voter instead took a long time and looked very closely at the ballot to read the names on the ballot.  Another voter signed a declaration of assistance and had his wife help him.  Neither of these two voters were blind, however the font size on the display was far too small for them to easily read. The demonstration provided on the ES&S website for the iVotronic shows a machine with a &#8220;zoom&#8221; option.  When pressed, this zooms in the ballot with large print on a particular race.  For these voters, such an innovation would be a wonder.  I highly recommend looking into this for the November race as it will bring new freedom for these voters.  For those who cannot read at all (because of blindness, illiteracy, etc), more information may be helpful to describe what the audio ballot is.  As poll workers, none of us had ever used the audio ballot, and when I asked about it at the training session I was told that it takes a long time.  The ability to present the same ballot in multiple ways is one of the strongest features of these machines, I believe that Allegheny county should be taking advantage of it.</p><p>There were four voters that asked about the openness of the new machines layout, indicating that they were slightly leery of the fact that anyone could see who was voting even if they could not see their votes.  While some of this was just yearning for the curtain enclosed lever booths, others seemed generally concerned they may be influenced or feel rushed &#8211; especially if a long line was developing.  The best explanation I could come up with was that the open nature prevented someone from using a camera phone and taking a video of the casting of  their ballot &#8211; thus preventing a new avenue for vote selling.  Isthere an official explanation of why the booths are so open, or is it just a design issue?</p><p>There were several other minor issues mainly related to running of the election and not so much related to voter issues that should have been addressed too. Firstly, it was a poor decision to have the PEBs sealed in the ballot box at the end of the night as this required the election board to open up the ballot box which may have had optical scan ballots in it.  Fortunately, our district had no optical scan ballots &#8211; there was a single absentee, which was a military write in ballot that was filled out completely.  Were there a handful of people who voted by optical scan ballot, they ballots would be in nearly sequential order and their votes could be found out.</p><p>The process for the handling of absentee ballots was confusing. Firstly, there was little guidance about what to do if a voter who was on the absentee list arrived to vote.  We were told that they could vote and we should dispose of their absentee ballot, however this is in direct contradiction to the text of the voting card which a voter signs.  On these cards, the voter is making a declaration that they haven&#8217;t voted by absentee or any other means.  Clearly, these issues need to be reconciled.</p><p>Another large difficulty we had was closing down the polls at the end of the night.  There was no cohesive set of instructions for all the envelopes or source of all the documents.  In fact, both districts at our polling place lacked the affidavit form we needed to sign if one initialed in the voter book.  If this material were better organized, perhaps into a binder format with a checklist for the end of the night, it is my belief that things would go better and faster.  As a judge, one thing I struggled with, and I noticed many others also were struggling with was what material to bring into Reisenstein school at the end of the night, what to put in the ballot box, and what to leave in the suitcase.  A single checklist of tasks could make this much easier and save time for all those involved in the election process.</p><p>Finally, one point where there was much confusion was regarding canceled ballots.  In the training session we were told that a canceled ballot would show up on the public count for the voting machine, when in fact they did not (this was confirmed by speaking with the judge in a neighboring district during the day who did not see any result from canceling votes).  Was this the same issue that prevented the sample machines used in training from counting canceled ballots?  Or are canceled ballots only counted in the protected count, or not at all?  If canceled ballots are not counted is there harm in the judge opening up a ballot and showing a voter how to use it and then canceling that ballot before bringing the voter her ballot?  Being able to show exactly what happens on the ballot would make explanation of the ballot much easier than having to leave the area around the voter as soon as they opening instructions disappeared.</p><p>Overall I had a very positive experience serving Allegheny County on election day.  It was a wonderful introduction into the nitty-gritty elements of democracy.  The election went much smoother than most imagined.  However, if voter turnout is high in November, which given the current Governor and Senate races in the commonwealth it probably will be, then addressing some of these issues now could significantly help out in the future.  The favor of a reply to these issues would be appreciated as I believe it will make the election process run smoother and allow me to better serve the county.  You can reach me at the above address, or by telephone at 412-XXX-XXXX.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Patrick Wagstrom</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To my loyal reader (or perhaps readers, who knows) &#8211; you probably noticed some issued with the accessibility of this site over the past few days.  It seems like two different things were conspiring to take down my site.  The first is that my uplink connection has been a little flunky &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a WRT54Gv1 that I use for my net access and that&#8217;s been acting really strange.  The second is that my server, <a href="http://scissors.wagstrom.net/">scissors</a> has been acting a bit flunky.  Before I go too far, a little description of the box is necessary.</p>

<p>The machine is a circa 1997 AMD K6-200 with 96MB of RAM and Quantum Fireball 4.3GB hard disk &#8211; this was pretty hot stuff when I went to college in 1997.  Yes, that&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s my first computer from undergraduate.  The machine first started to have problems in the fall of 1999.  At the time I thought it was disk issues, so I bought a new disk.  That didn&#8217;t fix the problems, in fact, I think I threw out at perfectly good 8GB disk at the time because of the issues.  Really, it was just problem with the IDE cables in the machine, but I digress. That year I was working more or less full time and going to school, so I had money to burn. I plunked down some cash for an Athlon 700 machine, and that machine became my backup server machine (replacting a Pentium 60).  This is also where the machine got the name scissors, for scissors.dtd.iit.edu.  I used some of the original parts in my newer machines, this left scissors with a black and with text only video card, and a couple of ISA ethernet cards (at least they&#8217;re 3com).  Yup, 10mbps is the max ethernet rate on the machine.</p>

<p>This point was also the first time that I installed OpenBSD on it.  I believe it was OpenBSD version 2.5 or thereabouts - I actually paid for the CDs and have them laying around.  Since then, the machine has been upgraded to newer operating systems twice, first to OpenBSD 2.9, then again to OpenBSD 3.3.  It&#8217;s served as a mail server, online game server, and most importantly my personal web server for the last few years.  At some point, probably in early 2003 the fan on the CPU died, but it didn&#8217;t seem to affect performance, so I didn&#8217;t care.  At some point later the fan on the power supply died &#8211; once again it didn&#8217;t seem to affect performance so I didn&#8217;t care.  I now had a basically entirely silent machine.  Cool.  As an added bonus, according to my Kill-a-watt device, it sips power at a consumption of 33 watts.  This makes it nice and affordable to run.</p>

<p>However, the machine is now approaching it&#8217;s ninth birthday.  It&#8217;s had a good run &#8211; but all good things must come to an end.  I&#8217;ve been getting rid of my old stuff and well scissors, it&#8217;s time for you to go.  You&#8217;ve been replaced by the forward marching tide of technology. However, it&#8217;s a real pain to reinstall web servers all the time.  My solution?  Virtualization.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMWare Server</a> and my copy of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMWare Workstation</a>, I&#8217;ve created a very nice little <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> virtual machine.  Best of all, I&#8217;ve got all the services that previously were running between a couple of different servers consolidated onto this single box.  That means this virtual machine now acts as my trac, subversion, dav, and person web server.</p>

<p>Virtualization has quite a few benefits.  One of the biggest ones is that I can just copy the virtual machine from one physical computer to another.  This makes upgrades a breeze.  (As an aside, it also makes me wonder why I don&#8217;t just install VMWare Server on my <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> box in the living room and drop down to a single computer that is on 24/7.  Probably has something to do with the printer we never use I guess.)  Also, being virtualized, it let&#8217;s me test other configuration changes easier.  I can take a snapshot of the server in workstation and try an upgrade or change in software with no risk to the live machine.  The VMWare Server console lets me manage everything from my laptop too.  Wow.</p>

<p>I know that someone out there will believe that I&#8217;m a sellout because VMWare is closed source.  Which is probably partially true.  However, I&#8217;ve been using VMWare since it first came out.  Back at <a href="http://www.lecltd.com/">LEC Ltd</a>, we used VMWare on the developer workstations to see how the web pages would look on different platforms.  Of course, we never thought about using it for server use &#8211; but now it seems that&#8217;s what the cool kids are doing.  An astute reader might wonder why I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/">Xen</a> or <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a>.  With regards to Xen, I&#8217;ve heard that Theo considers Xen to be more of a toy, however he might be coming around to it (this was a year or more ago now).  I did notice that there is a <a href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/openbsd/2006-05/0260.html">Summer of Code request to make OpenBSD a native Guest OS</a>.  That might be really interesting, but it&#8217;s not here yet.  For QEMU, the big issue is that if you want native performance you need to the unfree accelerator program.  That, and it&#8217;s not as feature rich as VMWare.  Given that I have extensive VMWare experience too, it seemed like this was the fastest way to get running again.</p>

<p>So what is all this saying?  Basically, if you&#8217;re reading this weblog entry you&#8217;re connected to my VMWare server instance, now called &#8221;<a href="http://donkey.wagstrom.net/">donkey</a>&#8221; running OpenBSD 3.9.  Well, if this post is recent that&#8217;s what happening.  In the future I should be able to upgrade pretty easy.  For now, the host machine for Donkey is a Pentium 3/900 with 640MB of RAM.  So far, so good.  I took extensive notes about the whole process and will be putting together a nice writeup soon.  If you&#8217;ve got questions about the process, feel free to email me in the mean time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah yes, spring time in Pittsburgh.  That wonderful time of the year when you leave the windows open, enjoy walks in the park, and get excited because baseball is now well under way.  Well, most years this happens &#8211; just not this year &#8211; a combination of cold and rainy weather along with dismal starts from both <a href="http://pittsburgh.pirates.mlb.com/">the Pirates</a> and <a href="http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/">the Twins</a> has made May a little less than exciting.  However, one thing still happened right as planned, the Pennsylvania state primary.</p>

<p>Yes, the primary, that wonderful time of year when you discover <a href="http://www.isaacforcongress.org/">a real democrat is running against Doyle</a>.  However, aside from that race, and selecting the seven representatives for the state democratic committee, there really isn&#8217;t much to do.  Nope, for most people the primary on Tuesday was nothing more than a formality.  What made it interesting is that it was the first time that <a href="http://www.county.allegheny.pa.us/">Allegheny County</a> used the new electronic voting machines from <a href="http://www.essvote.com/HTML/home.html">ES&amp;S</a>.</p>

<p>I was curious about how all of this was going to work out, so I volunteered with the county board of elections to serve as an election judge.  Within the county, each polling place has 5 or 6 people assigned to it - a judge who is in charge of the polling place, two inspectors who are the ones who run the machines, and two clerks who check folks in.  Some polling places also have a constable present to help maintain order &#8211; especially useful when your senator, who lives in Virginia, <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06137/690798-85.stm">tries to vote in Penn Hills</a>.  These folks get up dreadfully early the morning of the election and arrive at the polling place no later than 6:30 in order to have the polls set up and running by 7am.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, nothing is set up, but the machines had already been delivered.  Before anything starts up, everyone must be sworn in. This requires at the minimum the minority inspector and judge to be present as the minority inspector swears in the judge who swears in everyone else &#8211; a sort of checks and balances system.  At this point the machines can be opened up and the initial zero tape can be printed out.  This tape, which must be posted at the polling place, shows that at the start of the morning all machines reported zero votes cast. Throughout the entire day only two people asked to see the zero tape, but I suppose that&#8217;s better than nothing.  Along with the zero tape, a plethora of other literature is posted on the walls, some related to the duties of the election workers, some related to voters, others on how to use the machines, and of course, the American Flag and no smoking signs.</p>

<p>Processing voters is relatively easy and straight forward.  One of the election works takes the PEB over to the machine and sets up the ballot for them, they then start to vote.  The user interface is a bit nightmarish and inconsistent &#8211; but it looks like that&#8217;s something they can fix in the future.  On our setup, one needs to select all their candidates, then hit a new touch screen button labeled &#8220;Review&#8221;, then hit a blinking red button not on the screen that says &#8220;Vote&#8221;, then hit the green button that appears on the touch screen that says &#8220;Confirm&#8221;.  It&#8217;s confusing for lots of folks.  We found that if we gave the voters a quick tour of how to interact with the machines that they usually could figure it out.</p>

<p>On occasion we had voters who had some issues with the machines. Usually, thanks largely to the setup of the machines, we could get a very good idea of what was going on without seeing their ballot.  I think throughout the entire day I only saw one persons ballot and that was because they forgot they needed to press the review button after viewing page two of the ballot.  Overall, we did not have to cancel a single vote and every one of the 143 voters at our polling place used the machines.  There was one voter who wanted to use a paper ballot, but the worker who has processing them did not provide the correct information and made it sound as though the paper were only if the machines broke &#8211; this was not the case on Tuesday &#8211; any voter could have used the paper ballot.  In our case we lucked out because dealing with paper ballots would have been much more difficult for us.</p>

<p>Turnout was VERY low for the election.  By noon only about 60 people had voted &#8211; by the end of the day we hit about 23% turnout - 143 people.  The afternoon was certainly the slowest time, lots of time to talk to Ian and learn how to do Sudoku and that sorta stuff.  At 8pm everyone was certainly eager to close the polls.  Scratch that, at 7:30pm they were eager to close the polls and started taking stuff down.  They were very disappointed when we discovered that we cannot close the voting machines before 8pm.  When 8pm rolled around closing the machines was pretty straight forward, using a special master PEB we closed the machines sequentially and printed out a tape of the final tally at the end.  The tape came out, and told us who won each race in our district.  Unfortunately, we have no way to verify that this was the case.</p>

<p>The hardest part of the night was dealing with all the other paper work required.  Unfortunately, the instructions are in a dozen different places and seemed to be conflicting.  For the November election I&#8217;m going to make one master list of what needs to be done so we can just follow that.  We produced four copies of our final tallies, sent one with the minority inspector, posted one on the front door of the school, and I took two with me to the county elections board &#8211; along with the absentee ballots, which are counted at the central county location.</p>

<p>Dropping stuff off at the county was a mad house.  Hundreds of election judges dropping off dozens of boxes.  Security was pretty good though, plenty of officers directing people and watching the ballot boxes.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes.  Paperwork all stamped, and in another few days I should get my $120 for my hard work.</p>

<p>In another few days I&#8217;ll write up some stuff on issues voters had with the machines.  Particular regarding the number of voters concerned with both usability of the machines and the lack of a voter verifiable paper trail.</p>

<p>Apparently some of my original emails to Cesar, the author of <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/">MCatalog</a> got lost in transit, or his replies did, or something.  Anyway, after my requests, Cesar asked if I would like to maintain MCatalog, I agreed to the task.  So that will make my branch of MCatalog more or less the official trunk of MCatalog.</p>

<p>I wish I could say something like &#8220;To celebrate the momentus occassion, I present to you MCatalog 0.3,&#8221; but I can&#8217;t.  I had a few <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/milestone/0.3">issues marked for 0.3</a>, but when they were all resolved it didn&#8217;t feel  like a new release.  At least, not a jump from 0.2 to 0.3, maybe a 0.2.1 release or something.  So, I went and added more stuff to my todo list of 0.3.  Anyway, look for a release in the next few weeks.  Also, please download it, try it out, and give it some love.  It compiles pretty easily once you&#8217;ve added the mono-dev package in <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Dapper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m making some good progress on my modifications of MCatalog.  I&#8217;ve already managed to remove the old Mozilla based shelf viewer for a shiny new one that uses <a href="http://www.cairographics.org/">Cairo</a>.  This has some nice performance improvements and provides better scaling.  Of course, layout changes are no longer a simple matter of changing HTML, but at the same time, I don&#8217;t need to muck around with JavaScript anymore.  I might see about removing it for the presentation widget too, saving memory overall (I&#8217;m not sure how much more memory each Mozilla rendering widget takes up if Mozilla is already loaded, but I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s a lot).</p>

<p>To celebrate my accomplishments, I put up a <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/">MCatalog Trac Server</a>.  It contains my web pages describing the project, but and feature requests that come to mind, and you can browse the source code there.  Also, it contains instructions on how to help me out. So, if you&#8217;re so inclined, please visit <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/">https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/mcatalog/</a> and start browsing and helping out.</p>

<p>I had really hoped that I wouldn&#8217;t have to do all this, but I&#8217;ve sent a couple of emails to every email address I could find for the original author and haven&#8217;t gotten a response.  I may have to try spanish pretty soon here.  I know he&#8217;s still around, because he periodically <a href="http://www.mcatalog.net/blog/">updates his blog</a>.  That gives me some hope at least.  For right now, I&#8217;m almost willing to say it&#8217;s approaching a fork of the original code.</p>
