"""
This module contains FileEntry class which is used to retrieve entries 
from a file system.  Since pulling data from the file system and parsing 
it is expensive (especially when you have 100s of entries) we delay
fetching data until it's demanded.

We know some metadata at the beginning.  This is the data that's
populated via the __populateBasicMetadata(...) method.  We keep
track of the metadata keys that it has populated and when we're
asked for something that we don't have, then we get the file from
the filesystem, parse it, and populate the rest of the metadata
and the contents of the file.

The FileEntry calls EntryBase methods addToCache and getFromCache
to handle caching.
