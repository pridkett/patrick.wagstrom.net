Time to give Fedora the boot?

I'm thinking it's almost time to end my love affair with
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> products.  I've more or less used
RedHat as my exclusive version of Linux for the last seven years.  I had a
brief (as in three week) foray with <a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">Mandrake</a> and about a six month detention with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as my main operating systems before.  I dumped Mandrake because, well
it sucks.  Any real Linux user will tell you that Mandrake is only one step
above Linspire.  I stopped using Debian back in early 2001 because I was tired
of the snails pace of development and I wanted to be able to use some real
software on my computer.
</p>
<p>
In general I've been happy with Red Hat products.  I've been known to defend
them on many occassions.  I've found that for me they're the right balance of
up to date software and ease of use.  Not to mention, it's no problem finding
other people who use the software.  However, when Red Hat killed the desktop
version and starting focusing solely on the enterprise version, things started
to go bad.  I initially switched to Fedora Core 1 when it came out last year.
In general, I was pretty happy with it, but it was lacking a lot of the neato
stuff that I really wanted, for example, Mplayer.  But it was good enough, it
had GNOME 2.4, which was the newest at the time.  It allowed me to use
<a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org/">RhythmBox</a> with no difficulty.
Initially, life was good.
</p>
<p>
However, as time went on, I found myself using a huge variety of other APT
repositories to satisfy my software needs.  My system became a kludge to say
the absolute least.  I knew that I'd never be able to do a clean upgrade again.
Now, it comes to the point where I need to do a clean upgrade.  I'm getting
frustrated that my development environment lags so badly.  I'd really like
to try out <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a> and to
upgrade my version of <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/devhelp/">DevHelp</a> but I cannot.  Beagle just requires too much new stuff (Evolution Sharp?!)
and DevHelp needs the 2.4 series of <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a>.  I
went and compiled the 2.4 series this evening, and it seemed to work fine for
the compile, but when I installed it, all my old GTK apps died.  Things were
not happy in Whoville.
</p>
<p>
So here is my radical concept.  Switch distributions.  I've been very happy
up to this point with <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> on my
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> box.  They've got the mad community
support of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, with the release
schedule of <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> and the up-to-date
software of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.  However, my window
is running short.  They've got a release candidate out right now, but I'd rather
have the complete thing which should be out soon.  Once that shows up I should
be happy.  At that point I can back up my files and upgrade.  Maybe next weekend
if the release comes out before then.  It needs to be one of these next two
weekends to give me a chance to clean up before I leave for CSCW.
