Not Work Safe URL Plugin

<!-- Date: 2003-12-04 22:51 -->
<p>
In the same vein as the lasturls plugin, I created a nws/nsfw plugin.  Now this
one monitors the stream of urls entered in the channel and records them.  If
someone types "nws" or "nsfw" on a single line by itself, the url is added
to the list of URL that are not safe.  In this way you can return home and
easily get just the pr0n urls (or stuff that other's might find questionable)
without having to filter everything else.
