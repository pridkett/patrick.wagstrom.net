The [National Institute of Standards and
Technology](http://www.nist.gov/) is holding [a
seminar](http://vote.nist.gov/overview.html) on December 10-11th to talk about voting systems.  One of the
issues they will address is computer security and openness.  Unfortunately, I
cannot make it down there because I've got finals that day, anyone else going
that would care to provide a report on this?
