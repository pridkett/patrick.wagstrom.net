Gizmo - It's like Skype, but without the suck

When all the cool kids were raving about 
<a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, I went and signed up for an
account.  I haven't used it much.  I think I got maybe two calls on it, and
both times I didn't have a microphone handy to actually take the call.
Something about Skype always made me a little uneasy.  Maybe it was the
fact that they didn't reveal just how it worked.  What encryption was in
use?  Could they drop in on your calls?  Well, now that <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a> bought Skype, I don't think I'll use them much anymore.
eBay is known for not being a very privacy friendly company, and let's face
it, their customer support sucks.

So what's a guy like me to do?  Well, luckily Michael Robertson (the same
guy behind MP3.com and <a href="http://www.linspire.com/">Linspire</a>), has
started a cool toy called <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</a>,
which is based on standard SIP technology. That's nice.  They also have clients
available for Windows, Mac, and Linux (linspire based debs, but whatever, it
works fine on <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a>).
</p>
<p>
What makes this really nice is that first, you get a free quarter to make
phone calls.  At 1.8 cents a minute to the US this won't go really far, but
it should be enough for me to make a phone call or two.  Second, because it's
SIP based, you can dial into your client from any regular phone.  There's a
<a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/access-numbers.html">list of access
numbers</a> for a large number of cities.  Just pick an access number, press 1, and then
type the SIP Phone number you'd like to dial (my SIP number is 1-747-617-4120).  With free long distance dialing
on cell phones, this means that it's no problem to call my computer from
your cell phone.  That's cool.
</p>
<p>
They've also got a slew of other nifty features, mainly made possible by using
a real standard.  For example, if I get a voice mail, it gets emailed to my
GMail account as a wav file.  Then I can download the file and listen to the
message at my leisure.  I would also think that in theory that it should be
compatable with <a href="http://www.zen13655.zen.co.uk/mythphone.html">MythPhone</a>, so you can easily integrate a phone into your MythTV box.  I'm just
in a state of wow right now.  Maybe one of these days I'll need to find a way
to hook up <a href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk</a> too.
