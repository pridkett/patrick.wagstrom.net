Here is an [interesting article](http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/biztech/11/12/outlookchallenger.ap/index.html) from CNN about how Mitch Kapor is working to put together another open source challenger to outlook.  So what makes his different from Evolution.  Well, it's not evolution to put it simply.  It still is open source and all, but it's gonna run on Windows and Mac to start with.  This is a huge boon to the system.  Kapor is known as the guy who started Lotus.  He also played a big role in crypto regs in the United States.
