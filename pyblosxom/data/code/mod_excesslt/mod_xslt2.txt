Apparently I won't have to take my time to write my own version of an
Apache XSLT handler.  Behold <a href="http://www.mod-xslt2.com/">mod-xslt2</a>.
It seems like it does everything I want it to do.  Including using the
<my:verbose>&lt;xsl-stylesheet ...&gt;</my:verbose> header for fetching
XSLT sheets.  Could be a nice combination with <a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">PennAve</a>, of course, it's not difficult to put the translation in PennAve
either.
