title: Preliminary Technorati Tags Support

I've added preliminary support for [Technorati tags](http://www.technorati.com/tags/) to my weblog.  The beauty of everything being all XML-ified on this weblog is
that it means this took basically 0 programatic support requirements.  A few small
changes were made to my XSLT so the tags show up on both the blog entries and on my
[rss feed](/weblog/index.rss).  One of the planned features for TimeSuck
is to give everything tags so it's all sucked together in one big happy family.  Thus,
clicking on a tag for "home" would bring weblog entries, photos, and links related
to that topic.  And in an ideal world, this would all be synchronized with sites
like [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) and
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/).
