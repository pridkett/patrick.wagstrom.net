I just noticed that James Ewing has a some [custom firmware for the
WRT54G](http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html) on his website.  I think I'll mess
around with some of these this weekend.  They've got all the features of
the newest LinkSys firmware and have some additional stuff so it's SSHable
and what not.  Pretty smooth.
