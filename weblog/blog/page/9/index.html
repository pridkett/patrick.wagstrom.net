  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m almost to the point where I&#8217;m ready to do a push out of the new 0.4 release of PennAve.  This release sees lots of new features and bug fixes that make the software even better.  Most of all, it&#8217;s got a UI that&#8217;s 83.6% sexier than the previous version, all at the same great free cost. It seems like most everything is working now, there are a few large known bugs that I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;ll get fixed before the release.  They currently are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651523&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">slideshow does not work in IE 7</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651525&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">possible to leak information about tags</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651528&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">images should have alt tags</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The astute observer will notice that there are a few other bugs also listed on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=657348&amp;group_id=110753&amp;func=browse">bug tracker page for PennAve</a>. These are fairly minor UI bugs that I&#8217;m not going to worry about fixing right now. If I get the chance, I&#8217;ll see about tackling them, but they&#8217;re not real high priority.  Also, I&#8217;m sucky at design.</p>

<p>So, if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous, hop on over to <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">my web photo gallery</a> and tell me if you see anything wrong.  Bugs can be submitted on SourceForge.net, or through an email to me.</p>

<time datetime="2007-01-19T11:08:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 19<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I finally hit my breaking point with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/">Evolution</a>.  It&#8217;s always been with it&#8217;s quirks, but in general it&#8217;s worked quite well for the last four years or so.  It&#8217;s address book had suitable functionality, and the filtering was okay.  But in reality, it sucked, just like all other mail clients.  For some boneheaded reason it would always start each message at the bottom of the message instead of at the top.  This meant lots of scrolling, which wasn&#8217;t ideal either.  Furthermore, Evolution would just randomly bounce me around in messages.  But, for all that stuff, I still liked the support it had for mail, calendar, and addressbook all in the same location.</p>

<p>However, at some point, we all need to let go.  We all need to say goodbye.  And sometimes these goodbyes are booting the offending person to the curb knowing that we&#8217;ll never see them again.  Evolution is an aging beast.  It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s bloated.  It&#8217;s slow.  It crashes all the time.  And it appears that it really isn&#8217;t maintained anymore.  All <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> seems interested in doing is getting it to work with Groupwise.  Seriously, who the heck uses groupwise?  That adds no value to me as an end user.  Oh well, I&#8217;ll save the rant on Novell for another day.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this migration problem is that all of my data is saved in custom formats within Evolution.  Suckage to the max.  In particular, there are three major sections of data that I needed to access: addressbook, calendars, and sent email.</p>

<p><strong>Importing the Addressbook</strong></p>

<p>This was actually the most straightforward of the processes.  It was a simple matter installing the <a href="http://nic-nac-project.de/~kaosmos/morecols-en.html">MoreColsForAddressBook</a> extension for Thunderbird, exporting my addressbook from Evolution as a VCard, and then importing the VCard into Thunderbird.  Voila, all of my addresses, both email and physical, were stored again.  However, it didn&#8217;t keep any sense of grouping, which is a little sad.  I&#8217;ll have to figure a way to work around that.</p>

<p><strong>Importing Calendars</strong></p>

<p>This was a little more difficult.  By default Thunderbird doesn&#8217;t have a calendar tool, instead you&#8217;ll want to install the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Mozilla Lightning</a> extension to Thunderbird.  This is the extension version of the very nice <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/">Mozilla Sunbird</a> calendar.  Lightning allow you to import iCal calendars and also use the webcal protocol to collaborate over the web.  One would think that this would be as simple as exporting my calendars from Evolution and then importing them again into Lighting &#8211; of course, things are never that simple.  Upon my import attempt I was greeted with the following error message:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/resources/images/blog/lightningCalendarImportError.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>A little digging found that the problem was due to the dates in the iCal exported file.  Specifically, Evolution violated the spec by not defining the time zone in the export.  All of the event start times were defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>DTSTART;TZID=/softwarestudio.org/Olson_20011030_5/America/New_York:
</code></pre>

<p>The issue?  Lightning does not understand the softwarestudio.org namespace for dates &#8211; and with good reason, the calendar output from Evolution is, of course, out of the spec which states that iCal files need to define the namespaces theyÂ  operate in.  If, we execute a a search and replace on the files to replace &#8220;/softwarestudio.org/Olson_20011030_5&#8221; with &#8220;/mozilla.org/20050126_1&#8221; then that fixed many of the problems I was experiencing.  The one major exception that I had was a calendar that had a few ical invitations sent via email.  There was no way that I could manage to get this calendar to not break Lightning, so I had to copy a few entries by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Importing Sent Mail</strong></p>

<p>This method takes a bit of time, but it seems like it&#8217;s the easiest method to copy mail.  As Thunderbird cannot read the mail directories of Evolution, we need to find a way to move it.  To do this I utilized my IMAP account and made some folders.  I copied the entire contents of my local sent mail from Evolution into this temporary folder, then I copied all of messages from the temporary folder to my sent mail folder in Thunderbird.  After this long process, which really was probably more roundabout than it should have been, I had all of my old sent mail imported into Thunderbird.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My component cable for my Wii showed up this week, and Zelda in 480p is much nicer than 480i.  However, I&#8217;ve got a slight problem.  Because I use a <a href="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-2q-49-en-15-rgbhv-70-1d2s.html">YPbPr to VGA transcoder</a> that only handles 480p, when the Wii switches to 480i output for things like GameCube games, I can&#8217;t see it.  The simple solution is just to always switch cables, but, that doesn&#8217;t satisfy my hacker instinct and may be hard on the Wii.  Can&#8217;t I just make one cable with a switch between them?  Yes, of course I can.</p>

<p>With that, I present my first ever <a href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructable</a>: <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/EQWN8OH1UIEV2ZGZHG/">Nintendo Wii combo Coponent/Composite Cable</a>. Please, take a moment, go look at it, and see if you an pull off the same thing. As always, you can break your Wii, make yourself sterile, and potentially ruin your life with this, but that&#8217;s a small price to pay for laziness.</p>

        <figcaption>The line at Walmart. Are you here for the poinsettias too? </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>On Saturday, November 18th, 2006, I found myself inside the lawn and garden section of a local Walmart. I had come prepared.  Papers to read, books, movies for the laptop.  I was ready for a camp out.  So were some fifty other people.  The object of our desire, the 12:01am release of the <a href="http://www.wii.com/">Nintendo Wii</a>.  I arrived a little after 2pm, the list was organized and jovial.  &#8220;You here for the poinsettias too?&#8221; a well groomed guy in his early twenties asked me as I finally found where the line was hiding.  Next to him was a group of four other twenty somethings furiously battling on their DS Lites.  &#8220;We got a list.  Put your name on, hang out for a while.&#8221;  I looked at the list, I would be number 37.  Great, the person on the phone thought they were getting 50 or so.  I would go home with a Wii.  Around the line people were whispering that the total would be 63.  The sister of a co-worker seemed pretty reliable on that issue.  They told us they would tell us the final count at 5pm.</p>

<p>Great, that&#8217;s only three hours away.  I can wait that long to find out for certain if I can get one.  I was notÂ  camping out until midnight only to not get a Wii.  I sat down next to some other folks, a few years younger me than, and began to talk.  Some of the folks around me were casual gamers, like myself.  There was a 14 year old kid whose parents periodically came by to check on him.  And of course, the forty-ish mother who had no knowledge of the Wii, but happened to see the line forming at noon and decided to camp out.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2006/11/wiiLine2.jpg">
        <figcaption>Killing time in line. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>5pm came and went, still no count.  We would hear at 6pm.  The 14 year old was getting impatient, checking his cell phone for the time every other minute.  The other folks bought a game of scrabble and were busy with that.  I was reading materials for my class the next day.  It was going well.  At 6:20pm a Walmart official came in - &#8220;We have 31 Wiis for sale.  Each person will be allowed one Wii, three games, and one additional controller&#8221;.  Hearts sunk.  Roll call of the list revealed that 30 of the first 31 people were still there.  I wasn&#8217;t going to get one.  I went home, had dinner with my wife, and contemplated my next steps.</p>

<p>I had options.  Target and Best Buy were possible camp out sites. But, it was cold outside, I was not camping all night.  With having to teach the next morning at 10am, this would not be acceptable.  I might have been able to swing Target, arriving around 5am, but I would need to be home by 8:30am to get Kristina to Church.  No, that wasn&#8217;t going to work, there would no Wii purchased at retail on launch day.  What about the Internet?  Rumors abounded that Amazon would put the Wii on sale during the morning.  Well, maybe I can get up at 3am and get one there.  I didn&#8217;t set my alarm, but happened to wake up at 2:50am. Hopped on my computer, and hit reload furiously.  3:15am came and I realized it wasn&#8217;t going to happen.  I looked at other sites. Nothing. I headed back to bed, Wii-less.</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/wii/">Amazon&#8217;s Wii</a> information the next day, I saw a message board had popped up in the discussion section.  Great, lets see what people know.  Crap, I missed Micro Center having them available that morning.  Amazon sold out in less than a minute that morning at 11am EST.  Online was looking dim. I found <a href="http://www.ps3seeker.com/wii/">WiiSeeker</a>, which provided a list of stores that sold the Wii and estimated inventories that morning.  Gathering a list of phone numbers, I made a spreadsheet and started calling.  Nothing.  Some people were outright rude, Toys R Us told me they wouldn&#8217;t get more before Christmas.  Most places didn&#8217;t know.  The employees at Gamestop seemed to be the most helpful, but always said they didn&#8217;t know.  I hatched a plan, call every day, checking for inventory.  See what I can find.</p>

<p>Monday rolled around.  I did some work in the morning, then called the local Gamestops around me.  First one said &#8220;Maybe on Friday&#8221;.  The second one was pay-dirt.  They had 3 Wii&#8217;s that arrived 10 minutes beforehand.  I dropped what I was doing and ran the one and a half miles to the store.  Bingo.  Wii.  Zelda.  Happiness.  No extra controllers, no Super Monkey Ball.  But I had something.  Working was going to be very hard for the rest of the day.  I floated on the message board at Amazon, posted my success, and was able to help out another person in Pittsburgh.  She got her Wii twenty minutes after me.  The last one.  I felt like I did my part to better the world for the day.</p>

<p>I skipped my seminars for the rest of the day, went home, rewired my entertainment center, and had the Wii up and running within 10 minutes.  A little finagling was required to get it on the wireless network &#8211; mainly because I don&#8217;t broadcast my SSID at home, so the Wii couldn&#8217;t automatically detect it.  No problem, type the name in using the Wiimote, which is surprisingly easy, but not so fast, and enter the encryption key.  Bingo.  Online.  Wait twenty minutes for downloads of system updates, and I was good.  Awesome.  Time to pop in Wii Sports!  It was 3pm on Monday, November 20th.</p>

<p>As a I learned to bowl I kept on saying to myself &#8220;Wow, this is pretty easy.  Just like they showed in the videos.&#8221;  My first game was a 111, not bad.  Not great either.  The sport I really stunk at? Baseball.  I lost six to nothing.  Boxing was okay, but seemed really disjoint.  It was all individual bouts with no pattern, no evolution, and no title bout.  Bummer, the reviews might have been right on that one.  Tennis and golf were both better than expected and very enjoyable.  The games were not difficult to grasp, but getting good at them was going to take some time.  After a few hours of bowling, tennis, and golf, it was time for Zelda &#8211; <strong>the</strong> game for the Wii console.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2006/11/wiiDiscReadError.jpg">
        <figcaption>Unhappy Wii Sports Disc </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>I slid the disc in.  Uh oh.  The Wii menu said that it could not read the disc.  Crap.  Pop Wii Sports back in.  No dice.  My console wasn&#8217;t reading anything.  Back to Zelda, the menu comes up to play Zelda.  Great, I tell it start.  It&#8217;s slow.  It reminds me of playing an original Playstation game.  Horrible load time.  I start the game, the intro cinematic is slow and jerky.  Now it starts jumping around. What the hell is going on?  This won&#8217;t do.  I turn off the Wii and turn the Wii to lie flat instead of being on it&#8217;s side.  It seems like everything is working better.  Zelda plays just fine now.  Yay.  Let&#8217;s go explore Ordon!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, now that I had a Wii, I set my sights on the next goal.  Getting a Wii Remote for two player action.  This was going to be hard.  Nothing on Tuesday.  I called a dozen places, and drove to Best Buy and Target, only to return empty handed.  We still were going to be single player for a while.  Wednesday started out grim.  I called up the same Gamestop I had bought the Wii from, no luck. Another Gamestop, about a mile from work, had a few Wii Remotes in stock.  Dropping what I was doing, I ran to the bus.  I arrived only too late.  The guy right in front of me bought all three remotes. Crap.  I&#8217;m stuck in one player land.  I got back on the bus to sulk&#8230;and in the process missed my stop and ended up by the other Gamestop &#8211; the one that has told me 45 minutes earlier they didn&#8217;t have any.  I stopped in, and what&#8217;s this?  A Wii Remote just taken out of the shipping box.  Awesome.  No nunchuks, but at least I have another remote.  I also got Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz and a classic controller.  Much rolling of monkeys was about to ensue.</p>

<p>And rolling they did.  Super Monkey Ball reminds me quite a bit of <a href="http://icculus.org/neverball/">Neverball</a>, which can be played in a similar manner when using a tilt sensitive controller. Only Super Monkey Ball has much better graphics, sound, levels, etc. The 50 minigames included were quite a bit of fun too, but some, honestly, were pretty bad.  Maybe they&#8217;d be better with four people or something.  I dunno.  Mainly it seemed like the games where you had to aim the remote at screen were the hardest, largely because they lacked the visual cue to where you were aiming and required such frantic motion that it made things difficult.  That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t enjoy Super Monkey Ball, I just enjoy Wii Sports and Zelda a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Thursday was Thanksgiving.  I was thankful for my Wii.  I played lots of Wii Sports and a bit of Zelda.  Unfortunately, my Wii began to show the black screen of death again.  Bullocks.  I played with the discs and it appears to be just Wii Sports.  Oh well, more Zelda and Monkey Ball for me.  IfÂ  Nintendo has support people working on Thanksgiving I wasn&#8217;t about to call them.  Let them relax for a bit.</p>

<p>Friday.  Friday.  Ah yes, the day when Gamestop told me they might have Wii&#8217;s back in stock.  Well, I no longer wanted a Wii, but still was in search of an additional nunchuk controller.  I figured showing up early would be nice.  I arrived at 6:45am for a 7am store opening. There were six other folks in line.  Three people had camped through the night.  They were quite excited about getting their new Wiis. They started pimping me for answers when I revealed I bought a Wii on Monday.  Lots of questions about Gamecube controllers and games too. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve never bought a console before.&#8221;  It got me thinking, I had planned on picking up a few Gamecube games, namely Super Smash Bros Melee, maybe I&#8217;ll look a bit more at them.  7am rolled around and the manager came out &#8211; &#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for a Wii or a PS3 and you&#8217;re not one of these two guys, go home.  We don&#8217;t have any.&#8221;  They had two Wiis and not a single PS3.  Wow.  These things were scarce.  I got lucky on Monday.</p>

<p>After a long time browsing, because I know nothing about Gamecube games, I picked up six games and two wireless controllers. Total cost, about $50, same as a new Wii game.  I now had Need For Speed: Underground, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4, Metroid Prime, Zelda Windwaker, Williams Arcade Classics, and of course Super Smash Bros Melee.  I nearly choked over the $27 cost of Super Smash Bros &#8211; but at least I got it as part of a buy 2 get 1 with the controllers.  I got home and started to play my other new games.  For the most part the graphics were comparable, but they just didn&#8217;t feel right.  I love racing games, but Need For Speed: Underground just feels dirty.  Even Super Smash Bros isn&#8217;t quite the fun I remember.  Make no mistake, I&#8217;ll love whooping up on people until Super Smash Bros Brawl comes out, but they didn&#8217;t seem as nice and clean as the Wii games.</p>

<p>Throughout the course of the afternoon, I played numerous Gamecube games with no problems.  &#8220;Well, at least my Wii isn&#8217;t broken,&#8221; I thought to myself.  It can read Gamecube games just fine, and actually, I realized, it wasn&#8217;t having any problems with Zelda or Super Monkey Ball.  Wii Sports was just getting worse.  That night I decided that maybe my entertainment center had gotten too messy. Something needed to be done.  The MythTV Box had to move back into the entertainment center and the Wii couldn&#8217;t be sitting on top of it. The stereo, which was brought down for the Wii also should be moved into the entertainment center &#8211; previously we just used a set of computer speakers on the MythTV box.  The problem is that not everything would fit, so it was time for some carpentry.</p>

<p>Saturday morning I got up, took down all the stuff from the entertainment center cleaned it out and started to hatch a plan. Armed with a trusty jig saw, a drill, and a dust buster, I began to carve a few holes in my entertainment center.  This would needed for running some cords and ventilation.  After about an hour of work, the system was put back together, unused items removed, cords cleaned up, and looking much neater.  The Wii was alone on top of the center and the MythTV box was nicely hidden.  However, Wii Sports still wouldn&#8217;t read.  I was starting to get angry and worried.  What if my Wii is broken and won&#8217;t ever work well?  How long will it take to get a new one?  Luckily, I found stories of folks who had defective units that were getting new ones overnighted from Nintendo &#8211; way to go big N.</p>

<p>Sunday was fairly non-descript as there was little Wii use due to church, yard work, and enjoying the nice weather.  That evening I tried my daily fitness test on Wii Sports&#8230;Well, sorta.  I couldn&#8217;t get the disk to load for a long time.  After 10 tries, rebooting the Wii, unplugging the Wii, and trying a voodoo hex, I retreated to the cesspool that is general internet message boards.  Yup, I started to look at <a href="http://www.wiichat.com/">WiiChat.com</a>.  Wow, this could be a great resource.  Well, it could if you could filter out the kiddies who post incoherent replies to messages that try to start flame wars.  I found that, to my surprise, there was a small but substantial community of folks who were experiencing the same problem, just with Wii Sports.  Something strange has got to be happening here.</p>

<p>Delving deeper I found dozens of non-sensical suggestions and of course the usual response from a 12 year old &#8220;put the disk in the write way you moron&#8221;.  A few made some sense.  Some people suggested turning the console.  I thought about it, Wii Sports worked best when my console was flat.  But if that&#8217;s the case, I&#8217;d definitely have a defective Wii.  No, it looked like something else.  Filtering through the suggestions I found one that looked promising, &#8220;Move the Wii away from speakers, the magnets in the speakers may be causing problems.&#8221; It all seemed to make some sense.  My Wii was having problems when it was sitting right next to my crappy speakers.  These speakers are not shielded and can easily cause problems with CRT displays.  Oh the agony, I had my entertainment center looking so nice and neat.  Now I&#8217;d have to move stuff.</p>

    </figure>


<p>To my surprise, it worked.  Wii Sports would read after only twice of doing the disk thing instead of some dozen of unsuccessful attempts. Rock on!  But still, this issue with Wii Sports really bothered me.  I called up Nintendo and was told by their automated system that I should try back later because they were getting lots of calls.  The fact that it was 8:30pm EST probably didn&#8217;t help either.  I&#8217;d have to wait.</p>

<p>That brings me to today.  I waited until around Noon EST to make the call to Nintendo &#8211; figuring they were on the west coast and probably would get a decent number of support folks for 9am - 5pm shift. Within about a minute I was connected to a very helpful rep who walked me through some diagnostics.  I put a lot of discs in and out and was not able to replicate the problem on the phone.  I described the situation, what I knew about the system and my electrical engineering background, and why I thought it could be an EMF issue.  Well,</p>

<p>Nintendo doesn&#8217;t have anything in their troubleshooting guide about EMF issues yet, but the rep thought it could affect the whole system and seemed to think that there is chance it could affect just a lone disc.  Although, I&#8217;m a little skeptical about that, but whatever. Anyway, after talking to him, getting some game recommendations and previews of what&#8217;s coming soon for the Virtual Console (still awaiting a Mario Kart version), he said that they&#8217;d UPS me a new Wii Sports game at no cost.  Wow, that&#8217;s great of them.  So, in another few days, I&#8217;ll be the proud owner of two copies of Wii Sports &#8211; lets hope that at least one of them works.</p>

<p>Overall, my impression with the console has been quite positive.  I really enjoy the game play, and the controllers work pretty well.  The menu system provides ample feedback and is quite responsive.  Zelda is an absolute blast to play.  I&#8217;m about 20 hours into the game, and have completed two of the three temples thus far.  I&#8217;ve been quite impressed with the graphics, but remember, I&#8217;ve never bought a console &#8211; and the only console I&#8217;ve ever owned was the Genesis.</p>

<p>As far as the social gaming aspect works, I haven&#8217;t really tried that out yet.  My wife has played a few times and seemed to generally enjoy it.  She had no problem at all with getting used to the interface. After about a thirty second tutorial, she had no problem creating her Mii.  I still haven&#8217;t tried much of the whole group gaming action. We&#8217;ll try that this Friday when we have folks over.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a wonderful Wii filled week.</p>

<p><strong>Update, Tuesday, November 28, 2006:</strong> Wii Sports is being silly and not working again.  Oh well.  Also, on the photos of the screen, you&#8217;ll notice two sets of five white dots at the top of the screen.  That&#8217;s the IR emitters from the Wii Sensor bar.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a tasty little treat for you.  The <a href="http://secondlife.com/community/linux-alpha.php">Linux client</a> for <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> allows synthetic events to be sent to it.  What&#8217;s this mean?  Basically, it means that you can script X input with other programs throught the wonders of XSendEvent. Where I find this comes in useful is in the places where you have to camp.  Specifically, if you&#8217;re playing the horribly named casino game &#8220;Death Camp&#8221; you can make a killing just by occasionally sending keys to keep you from going idle and getting kicked of Second Life.  That&#8217;s exactly what this does.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s what you need to do.  Open up subversion and check out <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/slAntiIdle">https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/slAntiIdle</a> then compile it and just run it.  Start it up after you&#8217;ve started Second Life and it should automatically find your running Second Life client and send a series of alternating up and down keys, once every 30 seconds.  I&#8217;ve found this is just enough to keep me from going idle.  Plus, if you&#8217;re walking around, you usually won&#8217;t notice the intrusion.  Anyway, now that you&#8217;ve got it loaded, go to a casino with Death Camp.  Camp on a chair, plop the money in, and let the client run in the background.  I find it&#8217;s nice just to keep Second Life running in the background at school like this.  It&#8217;s a good way to make some nice profit.  Especially if you&#8217;re cheap like me and don&#8217;t want to pay.  We&#8217;ll so how long this lasts.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and for <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog/">Kenny</a>, I told you I would start blogging once you went away for a while.  Hah.  Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll stop by the time you get back from South America.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey you!  Yes you!  What does your computer do most of the time?  If it&#8217;s like most computers, it just sits idle.   Sure, some of us may have reasons to leave our computers on all day, such as a web server, or a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">mythtv</a> box, but even then they sit idle. Fortunately, CPU manufacturers have noticed this fact, and developed technologies that allow processors to slow down when not being fully utilized. On Intel chips this is called SpeedStep, and on AMD chips it&#8217;s called Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the dirty little secret you may have not known.  Altough the chip you bought may support this wonderful technology, your motherboard may not be able to enable it.  I previously had an AMD Athlon 64 3500+ in an MSI K8N Neo4 Platinum motherboard.  It was really a nice combination, worked pretty zippy. Then, when Conroe dropped at the end of July, I decided to take advantage of the price drops and install a nice new AMD Athlon 64x2 4400+.  After all, it was just a matter of dropping the chip into the board.  When I booted up though, I was greated by something I didn&#8217;t expect.  The new system was drawing 65 watts more power than the old system was.  Ouch.  A look at the dmesg logs showed exactly what the problem was.</p>

<pre><code>Aug  2 13:06:39 spongebob kernel: [4294696.356000] powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.50.4)
Aug  2 13:06:39 spongebob kernel: [4294696.360000] powernow-k8: BIOS error - no PSB or ACPI _PSS objects
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s odd, that can&#8217;t be normal.  I looked back further in my logs and found this result from my Athlon 64 3500+:</p>

<pre><code>Aug  1 07:10:00 spongebob kernel: [4294691.444000] powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.50.4)

</code></pre>

<p>Time for some fun hacking away at stuff.  Apparently, this means that my motherboard wasn&#8217;t providing the correct data in the BIOS for the operating system to know how to sleep the processor.  In other words, while my processor could be put to sleep, the motherboard didn&#8217;t know how to.  The specific item that Linux was looking for is called the Differentiated System Description Table, or DSDT for short.  Lucky for us, there is a feature of Linux that lets you override the motherboard DSDT with one you specify yourself.  Wonderfuly, just hack the DSDT and you&#8217;ve got powersaving!  Wait, you didn&#8217;t say we&#8217;re going to hack the firmware of a critical system did you?  Of course I did!  It&#8217;s not that hard, so let&#8217;s jump right in!</p>

<p>First things you&#8217;ll need the Intel ASL compiler/decompiler to build get your DSDT to a readable format.  Under ubuntu this is just a matter of running <code>sudo apt-get install iasl</code>.  Now we&#8217;ll dump the DSDT to a file and then decode it to make it human readable.  Linux is nice in that it makes the DSDT availble at <code>/proc/acpi/dsdt</code></p>

<pre><code>cat /proc/acpi/dsdt &gt; custom.aml
iasl -d custom.aml
</code></pre>

<p>This should have created a file called custom.dsl. Open it up with your favorite text editor and have a look around.  If you&#8217;re like me and lacking support for power saving, see a block for your processors that looks a little like this at the top:</p>

<pre><code>    Scope (\_PR)
    {
        Processor (\_PR.CPU0, 0x00, 0x00000000, 0x00) {}
        Processor (\_PR.CPU1, 0x01, 0x00000000, 0x00) {}
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The _PR scope defines ACPI information for your processors.  As you can see here, it&#8217;s completely empty.  There are a couple of ways to populate it, you can either trust the snippet of code that I&#8217;m going to paste below, or you can try to find your own information from the <a href="http://acpi.sourceforge.net/dsdt/view.php">ACPI4Linux DSDT Repository</a>.  You&#8217;ll need to find a DSDT for a motherboard that is reasonably close to yours, thus if you&#8217;ve got a socket 939 motherboard, like I do, you&#8217;ll need to find a DSDT for a different socket 939 motherboard. Unfortunately, their site is very difficult to navigate, so if you trust me, you can paste the information here.</p>

<p>Whew, that&#8217;s a lot of data.  Don&#8217;t ask me what it all means either, because I&#8217;m not an ACPI expert.  I had to dig around to find a DSDT that worked for me. You&#8217;ll notice that I have 4 different processor power states, which correspond to the states for the AMD Athlon 64x2 4400+.  If your processor doesn&#8217;t have four states, such as with an Athlon 64 3500+, then you&#8217;ll want to comment out the fastest state and change the line that says number of p-states to 3 instead of 4.  Anyway, your mileage may very. You&#8217;ll also notice that the first value for each p-state corresponds to the speed in MHz.  I&#8217;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader what sort of damage you can do with that.</p>

<p>Great, now you&#8217;ve got your spiffy new dsl file &#8211; time to compile it and have the kernel load it.  Running the command iasl -tc custom.dsl will produce a file called custom.hex, this is your new compiled DSDT table for inclusion in the kernel.  If you&#8217;re like me you might have had errors at this point.  If you&#8217;re smart, you can fix them, if you&#8217;re lazy you can ignore them. I chose the latter.</p>

<p>Because you&#8217;re running Ubuntu (right?), the kernel source tree already has support for Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet by default.  But it doesn&#8217;t enable drivers that require additional firmware.  Unselect Device Drivers-> Generic Driver Options-> Select only drivers that don&#8217;t need compile-time external firmware.  Then go to Power management options-> ACPI Support -> Include Custom DSDT and give it the path of your custom.hex file you just created.  Finally, rebuild your kernel with make-kpkg clean &amp;&amp; make &#8211;append-to-version=-customdsdt kernel_image modules_image kernel_headers initrd.  This will dump a few new .deb files in <code>/usr/src</code> for you.  Install them with dpkg -i and reboot!</p>

<p>After the reboot your system will take lots of juice initially, that&#8217;s because a system is usually pegged during the boot sequence, but afterwards it should drop precipitously.  You can verify it&#8217;s working by looking at the contents of your dmesg output and see the following:</p>

<pre><code>[17179571.504000] powernow-k8: Found 2 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.50.4)
[17179571.508000] powernow-k8:    0 : fid 0xe (2200 MHz), vid 0x6 (1400 mV)
[17179571.508000] powernow-k8:    1 : fid 0xc (2000 MHz), vid 0x8 (1350 mV)
[17179571.508000] powernow-k8:    2 : fid 0xa (1800 MHz), vid 0xa (1300 mV)
[17179571.508000] powernow-k8:    3 : fid 0x2 (1000 MHz), vid 0x12 (1100 mV)
</code></pre>

<p>If you see something like this, congratulations, it&#8217;s working quite well.  It&#8217;s not perfect, I still get a few little error, but at least Cool&#8217;n&#8217;Quiet works now.  My system idle power dropped from 195W to 134W.  Going off the rough estimate the 1W of power costs about $1/yr, that&#8217;s a saving of $61!  Nice.  Of course, it took me about four hours to figure this out, which means it may have not been worth it, espeically if I apply a discount rate to my future savings, but I digress.  If you use external proprietary drivers, it might be worth your time to install module-assistant so those get compiled too.  Otherwise you&#8217;ll boot your nice new kernel without support for 3d acceleration and all that jazz.</p>

<p>After all of this, I found a nice package that allows for the placement of the <a href="http://gaugusch.at/kernel.shtml">DSDT in the initrd</a>.  Using this method, you don&#8217;t need to recompile your kernel every time you change your DSDT &#8211; instead you just rebuild your initrd.  Very nice for situations where the drivers aren&#8217;t always built as part of the kernel build process, such as <a href="http://www.ivtvdriver.org/">IVTV</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Somehow I&#8217;m becoming a bit of a <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/">treehugger</a>. Either that or I&#8217;m just getting annoyed with how hot rooms in the house get as a when I have computers on all the time.  So, I set out to figure out how much power each of my computers takes to run and how much this power costs.  The easiest way way to measure these devices was with my handy <a href="http://www.p3international.com/products/special/P4400/P4400-CE.html">Kill A Watt</a>. A rather nerdy Christmas present from Kristina a few years ago (I asked for it).</p>

<p>To test each of the machines I hooked them into the Kill A Watt for an extended time period and watched the load of the machine at different times.  For multiple tasks on the machines I would read the Watts from the Kill A Watt and then look at the overall power usage over an extended period.  For the costs of electricity I used the price on my July 2006 statement from <a href="http://www.duquesnelight.com/">Duquesne Light</a>, which is about $0.10 per KWh.  At this rate, 1W on all year costs a little under a dollar.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s start out with dearly departed Scissors.  Unfortunately, I did the measurements on scissors a long time ago and since have given it away, so I couldn&#8217;t get the same variety of measurements.  Scissors was a tiny K6-200 machine with 96MB of ram and a single Quantum Fireball 4.3GB hard disk.  It had no other disk drives, furthermore, the fans on the machine were broken.  Over a course of 100 hours, this machine consumed about 3.78KWh - an average usage of 38W, for a yearly cost of $32.58.</p>

<p>Next I monitored the power consumption of Igel, my current server machine.  This machine is a PIII-900MHz machine with a single 45GB drive, CDRW drive, and 768MB of RAM.  As this is a server, I didn&#8217;t break the load down by category.  Over 1222 hours (yes, that&#8217;s well over a month), the machine used 84.4KWh of power, for an average consumption of 69W and a yearly cost of $59.22.  The faster machine costs nearly twice as much as the older machine to power.</p>

<p>Next up I did two rounds of measurements on Spongebob, my MythTV box.  The first round of tests were done before the upgrade I gave it as a birthday present to myself.  At this point, Spongebob was an AMD Athlon 64 3500+ with 3 200GB hard disks, 1G of ram, a WinTV PVR 250, a pcHDTV HD-3000, and a DVD drive.  I should also mention that the northbridge fan was not working.  Over 96 hours the machine used 10.17KWh of power, for an average of 106W and yearly cost of $90.  When watching HDTV the consumption shot up to 130W - increasing the cost to $111.  Luckily, it&#8217;s not watching HDTV that often.</p>

<p>Recently I upgraded Spongebob to a AMD Athlon 64x2 4400, 1 200GB hard disk, 4x320GB hard disks, 1G of ram, a WinTV PVR 250, 2 pcHDTV HD-3000s, and a DVD drive.  I also replaced the northbridge fan with a really fancy lanboy style cooler.  Initially, however this new configuration did not support CPU throttling.  The load was averaging about 165W making the cost $142.32.  Ouch.  That had to change.  Luckily, there&#8217;s a way to fix this that involves hacking your kernel and your ACPI settings, but I&#8217;ll cover that later.  When monitored over 97 hours the machine consumed 13KWh of power, for an average of 134W and a cost of $114.89. Watching HDTV put the usage back up to 165W, which left the $142.32 cost.  Overall, adding in the upgrades costs me about $25/yr in power costs, significant, but still the MythTV box comes out to less than $10/month.</p>

<p>For convenience, here&#8217;s a chart showing some of the power costs:</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Machine</th><th>Avg W/h</th><th>Yearly Cost</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Scissors</td><td>38</td><td>$32.58</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">AMD K6 200, 4.3GB disk, 96MB ram</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Igel</td><td>69</td>$59.22</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">PIII 900, 45GB, 768MB ram, CDRW</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spongebob</td><td>106</td><td>$90.83</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Athlon 64 3500, 3x200GB, 1GB ram, DVD</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Spongebob</td><td>134</td><td>$114.89</td></tr>
    <tr><td colspan="3">Athlon 64x2 4400, 1x200GB, 4x320GB, 1GB ram, DVD</td></tr>
</table>


<p>So what&#8217;s this going to change?  I had no idea that running Igel was costing me $60/yr for just power.  Wow.  That&#8217;s gonna make me do one of two things, either migrate the virtual machines down to the MythTV box, or purchase a cheapo shared server &#8211; probably the former.  With that sort of change, our power consumption will be under the levels from when I had scissors as my server and the pre-upgraded Spongebob as MythTV (total consumption of 141W) as opposed to 134W now.  Still, I&#8217;m a little shocked at the power consumption of everything.  I wish I had an easier way to quantify the power consumption of individual components of the system.  If anyone knows of a way, short of ramming probes into the system, I&#8217;d love to hear it.</p>

<time datetime="2006-08-07T22:30:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Aug 7<span>th</span>, 2006</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to freedom, there are several levels of software out there.  At the most difficult level is subscriptionware.  This covers packages like <a href="http://www.sas.com/">SAS</a>, a very powerful statistical analysis package.  These tools typically cost thousands of dollars and require a new license to be obtained every year.  Once the clock on your system ticks past the final date on the license, the software ceases to work.  While it&#8217;s not ideal, it&#8217;s in the license agreement, they never promised that you could lookÂ  at, manipulate, or even use it, outside of that agreement.  Today, the copy of SAS on our server died because the license expired.  Fortunately, I go to <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>, where they shell out thousands of dollars for Windows and Linux licenses for SAS.  A simple email got me the updated license.</p>

<p>Another level of software is those that require activation or a serial number but then keep on working because there is no need to check the license anymore. Many games are like this.  Windows used to be like until they instantiated the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/whyValidate.aspx">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> program.  These packages usually don&#8217;t include source, but they should still keep on working.  As an example, I was able to install the <a href="http://www.battle.net/">Battle.Net</a> edition of <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/war2bne/">Warcraft 2</a> last week using my original key.  No problems at all</p>

<p>At the next level is &#8220;free&#8221; software.  This is closed source software that is freely available, but not redistributable or otherwise may cause difficulties. Some of the software from <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/">SysInternals</a> falls into this category.  On the Linux front, there really isn&#8217;t much software that falls into this category, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/">VMWare player</a> and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/server/">VMWare server</a> do, however.  In VMWare Player&#8217;s case, it just works.  There isn&#8217;t a need for a serial number or anything like that.  Server is much more insidious, because I have been beta testing the software, my version was time limited.  I run my server under VMWare server, with very little trouble &#8211; until today.  Today I noticed that my server died.  I logged into the VMWare server console for the first time in what seemed like months, to be greeted with a message that my license had expired and ceased to work.  Getting a new license just required vising a web page, but I ended with a non-sensical error message about the versions required, and finally realized I needed to upgraded VMWare server. In my case, this produced a 3-5 hour outage on my server this afternoon.  I&#8217;m still a little confused about whether or not I&#8217;ll be forced to upgrade again in the future.  This was certainly an annoyance to me, and something I really didn&#8217;t want to deal with today.</p>

<p>Another example of &#8220;free&#8221; software that you run into a lot is <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a>.  You know, that language that could have toppled Microsoft if only <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> had a brain about making it easier to redistribute it.  Instead of using Java on the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop, we see that the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a> implementation of C#, a language directly from Microsoft, will be included in the next version of GNOME.  However, one good thing is that there is plenty of Open Source software for Java out there &#8211; <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta</a> come to mind very quickly. However, many of these packages rely on &#8220;free&#8221; but not freely redistributable software &#8211; such as the JavaMail package (in fairness, the recent versions of JavaMail have been made Open Source) &#8211; which then essentially makes the whole package not-free.  Today, I had the problem of trying to get <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a> working, but could not find some decent RPMs of it because not everything was freely redistributable.  Yup, here was a decent Open Source package being polluted by non-Open Source software.</p>

<p>At the best level is &#8220;free&#8221; and Free software &#8211; Open Source.  Software that you are free to redistribute, modify, share, examine, and most importantly use.  In each of the prior cases, the lack of Freedom made it difficult to actually use the software.  With true open source, you should always be able to use it.  Linking open source to non-open source is dangerous because it places an artificial limitation on using the software.  But there also is another dangerous problem with open source.  The subscription model, the same thing that I talked about earlier regarding SAS.  This is the technique that <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> has chosen with RHEL.  When your subscription runs out, your system breaks.  While the subscription is great for people who know nothing about system administration, it sucks for people who can administer a box and just need a nice repository to download files from and take care of dependency hell for them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, RedHat doesn&#8217;t seem to recognize this, and have locked up their entire repository behind a wall &#8211; sure you can get the source, but you can&#8217;t get the binaries.  Not without paying their fee.  At first I thought this wouldn&#8217;t be that bad.  But that was before our RHN subscriptions just randomly started to expire.  Suddenly our nice open source server is no longer usable either.  If you ever seen the circular dependencies that you get when trying to build many RPMs, you&#8217;d know why.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I ran into all of these situations today.  SAS died, my VMWare server suspended my machine because the license expired, my Windows VMWare box (running on my laptop install of VMWare Workstation) refused to upgrade, even though it&#8217;s a legal copy of Windows XP, Tomcat couldn&#8217;t compile because of stupid Java dependency hell related to closed source software from Java, and finally there wasn&#8217;t a damn thing I could do about it because the &#8220;subscription&#8221; on our server had expired.  Talk about an aggravating day.  Most of these packages have a truly free solution &#8211; for stats I can learn <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which is quite good, but still difficult to use.  I could use <a href="http://www.xensource.com/">Xen</a> for my virtualization.  I could just not test my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">photo gallery software</a> in Windows, and tell people to use something else.  I could recommend to the student who wanted Tomcat to use PHP, Python, or ASP.Net instead of Java server pages.  Finally, I could switch our server over to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and kick RedHat to the curb.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s the problem, they&#8217;re all just tools.  I already know the tools, I know them well, and they&#8217;re working.  Sure they really piss me off when all of them break because of the same reason (not being truly Free) on the same day (today).  But there is a massive opportunity cost in switching, and a greater cost if they can&#8217;t do something I need.  I realized that I&#8217;m facing the same dilemma that a lot of organizations and individuals face.  We could run Apache for our web server, but we already know IIS.  We could use Xen for virtualization, but we loose the live migration in VMWare ESX, or worse, without new hardware I couldn&#8217;t run <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.  We could use R, but it&#8217;s not clear how to create the same graphs we can create in SAS.  It&#8217;s not 100% that the Free software is broken, it&#8217;s just different.  And people hate things that are different.</p>

<p>What it comes down to is the intrinsic value one places on freedom related to software.  Do I feel bad when I use software that isn&#8217;t free?  A little, but not a lot.  For me I can live in the happy medium.  However, the line is always switching.  More frustrations may push the line closer to the switching point, likewise, new features in Open Source competitors help out too.  However, new features in the commercial software may make it more difficult to switch (this is one form of vendor lock-in).  However, one thing is for sure, I need to be cognizant of these situations and make my choices in light of the fact.  Because, as I found out over and over again today, free isn&#8217;t &#8220;Free&#8221;.</p>
