I've been writing a nice [tutorial on setting up MythTV on Ubuntu x86_64](/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml) over the course of the past few weeks.  Please feel free to browse
it and give feedback.  It still is a work in progress and I could certainly use some help in
some spots.  I should clarify this by explaining that I've got my system more or less working,
with the exception of static on my pcHDTV which I understand is an electro-magnetic interference issue that
I can't do anything about.  When I move that card into another computer, I'll add details about
that too.

For those that are concerned, I'll eventually put up a TRAC site for managing the project and
and providing access to the repository of revisions.  My goal is to provide a slightly more up-to-date
and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.com/) centric version of [Jarod Wilson's Fedora MythTV Guide](http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/).  I know, that's a lot of hoping.  Come on magic
[google juice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice), lead people to me.
