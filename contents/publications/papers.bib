	abstract = {In this paper, we develop a technique to measure how congruent the actual organizational communication channels are relative to the coordination requirement imposed by the dependencies among tasks. We examine the role of congruence in the context of a closed source project of a large distributed system. Our results show that congruence helped reduce resolution time of software modification requests. We also explore the evolution of congruence across several releases of the product. As task dependencies changed over time, we found that developers, in particular the most productive ones, change their patterns of usage of communication technologies such as Internet Relay Chat ({IRC)} and task-tracking systems. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of our technique for the design of collaborative and awareness tools.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {An important part of enabling the future information infrastructure is to provide con-
venient services for application users that make such an environment highly functional and
easy to use for the nonexpert. In other words, the scientist should be able to focus on the
science but should have sophisticated tools at hand that enable new and enhanced modal-
ities in which science can be performed. We describe a general architecture that provides
access to scientific applications. We demonstrate how such services can interact with each
other and be reused by the scientific application architect to orchestrate Grid services. Our
architecture is implemented by reusing concepts, infrastructures, and middleware from Web
and Grid services, as well as from the newest Globus Toolkit and the Java {CoG} Kit.
     We apply our general architecture to a specific application: active thermochemical ta-
bles. This application demonstrates a number of interesting and future-oriented uses, such
as the need for batch processing, interactive and collaborative steering, use of multiple
platforms, visualization through large displays, and access via a portal framework. Besides
the innovative use of the Grid and Web services, we also provide a novel algorithmic con-
tribution to scientific disciplines that use thermochemical tables. Specifically, we modified
the original approach to constructing thermochemical tables to include an iterative pro-
cess of refinement leading to increased accuracy. We have designed a variety of access
environments including a shell, a Grid desktop and a portal for accessing the set of ser-
vices provided, which include the display of network dependencies between the reactions a
chemist may be interested in and interactive querying of associated species data.
     Modalities that need to be supported are the protection of intellectual property, the
creation of metadata and information shared with and gathered by the community, and
easy access to the service by the application scientists.},

We have analyzed several methods of communication; a social

structure behind {F/OSS} projects. This social network data was used to create a model of {F/OSS} development that allows for multiple projects, users, and developers model we have been able to replicate some of the known phenomena observed in {F/OSS} and provide a first step in the creation of a robust model of {F/OSS.}},

	abstract = {Technical debt is a term that has been used to describe the increased cost of changing or maintaining a system due to expedient shortcuts taken during its development. Much of the research on technical debt has focused on decisions made by project architects and individual developers who choose to trade off short-term gain for a longer-term cost. However, in the context of enterprise software development, such a model may be too narrow. We explore the premise that technical debt within the enterprise should be viewed as a tool similar to financial leverage, allowing the organization to incur debt to pursue options that it couldn't otherwise afford. We test this premise by interviewing a set of experienced architects to understand how decisions to acquire technical debt are made within an enterprise, and to what extent the acquisition of technical debt provides leverage. We find that in many cases, the decision to acquire technical debt is not made by technical architects, but rather by non-technical stakeholders who cause the project to acquire new technical debt or discover existing technical debt that wasn't previously visible. We conclude with some preliminary observations and recommendations for organizations to better manage technical debt in the presence of some enterprise-scale circumstances.},

In order to inform the design of collaboration technology for creative work settings, we examined the nature of cross-group knowledge exchange in an innovative engineering research project developing a lunar rover robot as part of the Google Lunar X-Prize competition. Our study extends the understanding of communication and coordination in creative design work, and contributes to theory on coordination. We introduce four types of cross-team knowledge exchange mechanisms we observed on this project and discuss challenges associated with each. We consider implications for the design of collaboration technology to support cross-team knowledge exchange in dynamic, creative work environments.},

This is true in the case of Grid services as well. In this paper, we analyze existing technologies that address workflow for Web services, and try to leverage them for Grid services, which have different needs from standard Web services.

	abstract = {Software developers have long known that project success requires a robust understanding of both technical and social linkages. However, research has 
largely considered these independently. Research on networks of technical artifacts focuses on techniques like code analysis or mining project archives. Social network analysis has been used to capture information 
about relations among people. Yet, each type of information is often far more useful when combined, as when the “goodness” of social networks is judged by the patterns of dependencies in the technical artifacts. 
To bring such information together, we have developed Tesseract, an interactive exploratory environment that utilizes cross-linked displays to visualize the myriad 
relationships between artifacts, developers, bugs, and communications. We evaluated Tesseract by (1) demonstrating its feasibility with {GNOME} project data (2) assessing its usability via informal user evaluations, 
and (3) verifying its suitability for the open source community via semi-structured interviews.},

Therefore, it is particularly important that teams establish practices and adopt tools that will facilitate the long term success of the team. In this paper we examine a developing distributed team in process
of adopting tools to support distributed work. We identify initial tool selection decisions made and elicit the requirements for future tool use from the team. We then
relate these requirements to existing tools and research and provide recommendations for fertile research areas in the field of {CSCW.}},

	abstract = {Globalization has resulted in software teams that are increa-
singly large, multi-cultural, and geographically distributed;
and software systems that are increasingly dependent on
technology produced by remote teams or as commercial-
off-the-shelf (or open sourced). In such environments mak-
ing the right technical decision largely hinges on the social
context and trust toward the software producer. Creating
this shared context and building trust is not easy – especial-
ly when teams are distributed across international bounda-
ries, time zones, and culture. Creation of trust has thus far
been largely an informal process with little technological
support. However, the popularity of online repositories,
both public (e.g. {StackOverflow}, {GitHub} etc) and private
(e.g. internal source code repositories, project plans), that
store social and technical information has made it possible
to analyze past development and social interaction traces to
develop actionable analytics to facilitate building trust.},
