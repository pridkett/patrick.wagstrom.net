[IBM DeveloperWorks](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/) has
a nice article up about [Python development with Eclipse and Ant](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ecant/index.html?ca=drs-tp2604).
This makes me pretty happy because I had been looking for a decent way to use
Python with Eclipse and it looks as though there finally is one.  The question
now is, do I want to remain a preacher in the Church of Emacs, or should I
backslide and start using Eclipse?






On the plus side, I can use Emacs over a telnet/ssh session.  I suppose I could
with Eclipse too, but it would be horribly slow.  Also, I believe that Emacs
has better key bindings, or at least ones that I'm more used to.  However,
one thing that I really wish Emacs had was code completion.  It makes it a lot
easier for writing code.  Usually when playing with a new Python library, I
end up having to use an instance of IPython or PyAlaMode to get the information.
