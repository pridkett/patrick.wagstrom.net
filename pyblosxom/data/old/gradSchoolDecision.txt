Grad School Decision

<p>
So I've made my decision.  Next fall I'm going to be starting the Ph.D. program in <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">Engineering and Public Policy</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>.  The problem is that Pennsylvania is ass backwards and has a law that says that I can't bring <a href="/hedghogs/">my hedgehogs</a> with me.  So if you might be interested in giving either one a home, let me know.  Thanks.
