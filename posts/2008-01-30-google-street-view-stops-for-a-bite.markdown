I was looking for a store in the South Hills of Pittsburgh a few weeks ago and wanted to make sure that I found the store okay, enter Google Street View.  I popped up the location into Google Maps and started looking around.  Yech, it was pretty far off.  However, I did discover that even the googlers need to eat.  Apparently they favor [Wendy's](http://www.wendys.com/).
