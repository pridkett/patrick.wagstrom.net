title: What is Honesty?

It's more than a little ironic that the [MPAA](http://www.mpaa.org/) said that
the broadcast flag was about "[Keeping Honest People
Honest](http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000306.html)".  Felton makes
a good point about the whole definition of honesty.  It's even more interesting
when on considers some of the things that the MPAA has done and said in the
past.  Hardly a group of people who I would call honest.
