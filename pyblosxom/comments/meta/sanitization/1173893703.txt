<my:commentTime>March 14, 2007 at 13:35</my:commentTime><my:body>You bring up a couple of good points about whether or not I should just start anew or take the strategy that I took, which is whitewashing of certain political views and events in my life.  The whole issue is a little like trying to protect my political butt, even though I don't have any political aspirations at this time.  Rather, I realize that the job hunt, which I'm about to embark on, has gotten a little political.  I've talked to people recently who were denied jobs because they posted about issues on their MySpace and Blogspot issues that most likely cost them a job.  While a employer cannot ask about many of these issues, they're free to consider them if you bring them up.  Posting those thoughts on the Internet is one way to bring those up.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your question about deciding what I decided to keep and what I decided to scrap being as a valid point.  So I'll outline a little bit about how I came to the conclusions.  First of all, I had a lot of posts that were little one line rants about issue X or issue Y.  Frequently these rants were not well thought out and linked to content that is no longer available on the interweb.  Those posts were an easy judgement call on whether or not to remove.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I had a lot of posts that were void of any amount of coherent or interesting thought.  Does anyone care that I had a bad reaction to Vicaproferin, exactly as warned about on the prescription, back in July of 2002?  Probably not.  I had a lot of entries like this that really didn't mean anything and frankly I didn't care about them.<br/>
<br/>
The third criteria I used was whether or not the post added to discussion or knowledge about a subject.  Provided that subject was not me or my family, etc.  This is actually what kept a lot of stuff about the MythTV and the Wii on my website, because many of those articles get 50-200 hits a day.  I suspect that the reason for this is because they're interesting and have real content.  Longer articles typically are better because they provide something useful.  So, I've tried to keep the articles that were useful for something other than figuring out information about me.  The one category that I kept that may not be overly useful is the "meta" category, because most of those are helpful for understanding the context of the weblog.  This resulted in the removal of huge chunks of postings around book summaries and politics.  My book summaries were not particularly well written, and really just a way of keeping notes for myself, and the political stuff was really just a part of a larger echo chamber.  I wasn't adding anything.<br/>
<br/>
So that left me with a fairly solid core of my weblog, where I can write about issues which I believe that I'm rather authoritative on.  Namely the issues of technology policy, Linux and Free software, and online communities.  I believe that my postings on these subjects can actually be of value of the broader internet community and I'm not worried about people seeing my thoughts and opinions on those topics because it's what I do.  If someone doesn't hire because of something that is posted in those categories, I'd have a hard time fitting in regardless.   A lot of this is also why I've changed the subtitle on the weblog to "Thoughts of a Cautious Technocrat", because that's exactly what I am, and I'd imagine that a lot of my opinions and writings reflect that.</my:body>
