<a href="http://www.mindbending.us/">MindBending Software</a> produces nifty
products that inserts subliminal messages into games.  This is accomplished by
intercepting GL calls and layering new graphics on top of it.  They also
can perform some trippy transformations to get your zen on.  Unfortunately, it's
really expensive, most modules will run you between $700 and $1100.  Ouch.

In particular, take a look at some of the <a href="http://www.mindbending.us/videos.htm">videos</a> they have online.  I dunno if putting images of Jesus in
a kids game of Grand Theft Auto is really going to help them.  Interesting
technology none the less.
