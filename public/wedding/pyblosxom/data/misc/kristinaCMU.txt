Living Arrangements Looking Good

Lack of update for a long time because stuff was getting pretty confusing
and hectic in my (Patrick's life).  Dan moved out, so I had to find a new
roommate for the duration until Kristina moves in.  Well, that's taken care
of finally!  Yay!
</p>
<p>
Also, stuff is shaping up with where Kristina will be next year.  She has
been accepted into Chemical Engineering at Pitt and CMU with financial aid
and a stipend for both.  This is really great news and will make stuff much
easier on us.

It also means that she'll get to come out here a few times under the auspices
of looking at the universities.  This gives us some more time to plan for the
wedding.  So there should be more stuff up soon.
