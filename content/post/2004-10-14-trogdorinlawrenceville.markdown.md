Kristina and I were awoken at 4am on Wednesday morning to quite a ruckus outside
of our humble abode.  At first we thought that our neighbors were drunk and
making noise again, after all, they seem to enjoy doing that around 3am in the
morning, so why not 4am?  Then we heard sirens, and Kristina realized that the
ruckus was on both sides of our house.  Peeking outside, we saw lots of
fire trucks and smoke.  [Trogdor, the Burninator](http://www.homestarrunner.com/trogdor.html) had come to visit Lawrenceville.






This is where we might need a diagram to explain stuff.  So here is a quick
explanation of where we live:

What we didn't realize at the time was whether or not our set of row houses
was connected to the victim of Trogdor's wrath.  We couldn't get close enough
to tell and the firemen kept yelling at me when I crossed the street to see
bit better.  I'm still confused why they told us to stay on the side WITH
the fire.  Anyway, realizing that there was nothing we could and that there
was already four trucks on the scene, we tried to go back to bed.
Unfortunately, this house had a wooden deck so the firemen were using chainsaws to tear it down to prevent it from becoming tinder.  So it took a while
to get back to sleep.  Oh yeah, that and the fear of the fire that was 100
feet away spreading and killing us in our sleep.






Anyway, I took a couple of pictures of the damage this morning as I walked
past the remnants of the house on the way to the bus.  They don't really
do it justice for the complete loss of the insides.  Everything inside the
house is burninated.
