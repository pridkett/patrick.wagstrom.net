Loki Games Under Ubuntu : Alpha Centauri

<!-- Date: 2005-03-07 17:25 -->
<p>
It's spring break so I decided I would play a few video games.  I've got
a bunch of the old Linux ports of games from
<a href="http://www.lokigames.com/">LokiGames</a> (which went bankrupt in
a mess of supposed lies and missed payments in January, 2002).  Unfortunately,
these games need some work to function in Linux.  Well, at least the ones that
I've tried.
</p>
<p>
For Alpha Centauri, you should first go and fetch the patch for SMAC.  The
updates can be found at
<a href="ftp://sunsite.dk/mirrors/lokigames/updates/">sunsite.dk</a>.  Go
and download that.  Also, go and download the updated version of loki_patch
from <a href="http://icculus.org/~msphil/loki/x86/">icculus</a>.  Now, install
the game as you would normally.  The install worked just fine under my
version of Ubuntu (Warty, aka 4.10).
</p>
<p>
The tricky part comes with patching Alpha Centauri.  Running the patch generates
the following output:
</p>
<pre>Verifying archive integrity...OK
Uncompressing Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri 6.0a Update...................
./update.sh: line 60: 11336 Segmentation fault      loki_patch --verify patch.dat
The program returned an error code (1)
</pre>
<p>
This clearly isn't right.  So instead of running the patch normally, we've got
to do a bit of work.  Instead, run the patch with
<my:verbatim>sh ./smac-6.0a-x86.run --keep</my:verbatim>, this will preserve
the unarchived files in a directory called
<my:verbatim>smac-6.0a-x86</my:verbatim>.  Copy the new version of loki_patch
to smac-6.0a-x86/bin/Linux/x86/loki_patch.  Then go into the directory and
run <my:verbatim>update.sh</my:verbatim>.
</p>
<p>
So now we've got a nice updated version of Alpha Centauri, but it still wasn't
spitting out sound on my version of Ubuntu (I've mangled some stuff with
regards to <a href="http://http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> and ESD.
Also, I've read that there are some other issues with kernel versions.  To fix
this I created a little script and use this to run SMAC.
</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.6 SDL_AUDIODRIVER=esd /usr/local/games/smac/smacpack $*
</pre>
<p>
It may be possible to do other fun stuff using the 
<a href="ftp://ptah.lnf.kth.se/pub/misc/sdl-env-vars">other SDL environment
variables</a>.  As a side note, I could not get the dynamic version to function
properly, which is bummer because it means that I can't really update the
libraries and try other fun stuff with them.
</p>
<p>
As I play with other old games I'll post updates on how to get them going
in the weblog.
