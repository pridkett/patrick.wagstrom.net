A few weeks ago I posted about [The Great WPLUG pcHDTV Buy ](/weblog/2005/03/wplugPCHDTV.xml)and how I was I hoping to get 10 cards organized in a purchase.  Beyond my expectations, we managed to get almost 17 people to purchase cards.  This is 17 more people who are standing up and saying that the [FCC](http://www.fcc.gov/) must stop this lunacy with regulating content and the [broadcast flag](http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/). This is 17 more people who are exercising their rights to preserve data from the wireless spectrum that by definition belongs to the public.

If you missed the purchase then there still is a bit of time.   You can buy the cards until June 30.  After that point, the man puts the smack down on our fair use goodness.  If you're a member of [WPLUG](http://wplug.org/) you can use the code WPLUG for another $5 off.

I'll be giving a talk on these issues on June 4 at the [WPLUG](http://wplug.org/) meeting.  The first part will be about [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) and the second part (post lunch) will be helping people to build these things. Trust me, you want to miss it.  We're gonna have some free goodies from the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/) there too. With any luck we'll have some media folks come visit us too and get a good article in the [Post-Gazette](http://post-gazette.com/).

The cards should be here sometime next week.  I'll deliver them no later than the April 30 WPLUG/PghSage meeting.
