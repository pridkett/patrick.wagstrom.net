====================

This is the source code for my web page. You probably want to visit the actual
web page at http://patrick.wagstrom.net/ rather than just browsing this source
code, but hey, whatever floats your boat, man.

Installation
============

Ughh, this requires a lot of different packages.

    npm install -g wintersmith
    npm install -g bower-installer
    npm install

Now, to build it:

    wintersmith build

And to run a preview of the site:

     wintersmith preview
