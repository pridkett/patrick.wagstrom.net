<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/">BusinessWeek</a> has an <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2002/tc20020927_7367.htm">article</a> up about <a href="http://eldred.cc/">Eldred vs Ashcroft</a>.  On other interesting stuff, I found out that <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/">Lawrence Lessig</a> has a <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">blog</a> on his web page.  That might be a good thing to set up a news feed for so I can see updates on my page.
