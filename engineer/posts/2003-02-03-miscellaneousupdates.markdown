I think my broadband connection might finally be working, but I can't be wholly sure.  I haven't any problems for the last 20 minutes while I've been using an SSH session.  Ping times from campus to my home computer are back down to their usual 40ms.  I forgot how nice that was.

I've put up a webpage for [Project 175](/project175/) where you can track my fat ass as I try to lose about 45-50lbs of lard.  I've become a tubby bitch over the past few months, so I'm hoping that this will help provide me with some motivation to unlardassify myself.
