Luddition

Last week, <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog">Kenneth</a> decided to try
and coin a new term, "Luddition Through Economics".  Such a term basically
means that someone is a luddite because they don't have the money to not
be one.  I guess that describes me fairly well.  Well, actually, it was
coined to describe me.

Anyway, the discussion progressed to see if he could become the top hit
for such a phrase.  It shouldn't have been hard because "Luddition" isn't
really a word.  Well it is, we defined it as "the process of becoming a
luddite", but whatever.  Anyway, so he's now <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=luddition+through+economics">top hit on google for it</a>.
</p>
<p>
So then the question is this, why am I writing about "Luddition through
economics".  The answer is simple, I'm trying to see what it takes to knock
him out of first place.  This is a little Google experiment if you will.
