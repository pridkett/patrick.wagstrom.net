It's a good thing that I live in an area where not that many people have
computers.  I doubt that anyone above or below me has a wireless keyboard.  My
neighbors are old folks who probably don't have a computer.  But in Norway,
well there you could be [using the same keyboard as your
neighbor](http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=474623)
and it might take a while to find out.  Well, not the same keyboard, but you
would get interference.  This seems a little odd, I had my computer over at my
brothers house, where he also has a Logitech wireless keyboard, and we had no
problems there.  ::shrug::
