title: Slides from WPLUG MythTV Talk
url: /weblog/2007/10/20/wplug-mythtv-talk/
---

Today I gave a talk to [WPLUG](http://www.wplug.org/) on [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/).  I think it ended up going pretty well and it was quite well attended.  Most people seemed interested in seeing what they could do with scavenging some computers and trying to get started with MythTV on the cheap.  That's pretty easy if you just want to go standard def: pick up a WinTV PVR-150 card and you'll be on your way.  If you want to go high def, you'll need a bit faster of a processor, the kind that most people may need to purchase a new system for.

On of the things that I think was really helpful was a set of slides I put together on questions to ask yourself before building a MythTV box.  In hopes that this helps some other folks, I've [posted the entire set of slides here](/misc/20071020-WPLUG-MythTV.pdf).  Unfortunately, most of the talk was demonstrating MythTV to everyone, so you'll lose some context there.  I'll try to answer questions if possible.
