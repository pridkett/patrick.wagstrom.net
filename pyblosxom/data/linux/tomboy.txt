Tomboy

While I'm talking about cool and interesting applications, I shouldn't forget
to mention <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a>, a
nifty little note taking application that automagically links your notes
together as you go.  Very cool.  Support is in the works for allowing you
to annotate your desktop objects using Tomboy.  I can definately see this as
something that will make its way into the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME
desktop</a> very fast.  Also, you can search your notes using <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a>.  All this technology is mad cool.
Now, if only I had a more up to date distro to run it on.  Oh well, after
the quals.
