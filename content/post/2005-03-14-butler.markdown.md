Ah yes, the joys of an open platform bringing innovation back to the web.  It's
really a wonder to see all the cool extensions hackers are creating for
[FireFox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&id=38177&t=82).  A few weeks ago I installed
[Google Preview](http://ackroyd.de/googlepreview/), which provides
very cool tumbnails of webpages on Google.  Today, I found out about
[GreaseMonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/) which lets you add
custom scripts for different webpages.  For example,
[Fidelity](http://www.fidelity.com/) still has some b0rkage in
their login on Firefox in Linux (it doesn't recognize X11 as a platform so
things don't quite work right, like research of stocks and funds).  I can go
and hack together a script and it will automagically fix the site for me.  One
could imagine some cool extensions for web based games, ala the cool old school
Trade Wars 2002 scripts for Telix.

But I didn't just stumble upon (which is another extension, I haven't played
with it yet though) [GreaseMonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/).
It was discovered because I found [Mark Pilgrim's](http://diveintomark.org/) great new script called
[Butler](http://diveintomark.org/projects/butler/).  This little
guy hacks up the search results for Google and removes all the ads and
provides additional links to interesting sites.  Most cool.  I'm cotinually
amazed by the innovation that comes out folks hacking on FireFox.  I feel very
meek in comparasion to their geekiness.
