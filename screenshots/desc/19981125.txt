After playing around with MLVWM, I decided it really wasn't worth my effort to hack it all up.  So
I switched back to good old reliable <A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org/">Window Maker</A>.  The
background is from <A HREF="http://www.interplay.com/fallout2/">Fallout 2</A> by
<A HREF="http://www.blackisle.com/">Black Isle Studios</A>.  Although its not Linux, I really
like fallout and fallout 2.  So Nyah.
