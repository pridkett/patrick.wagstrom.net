So this entry has nothing to do with me really.  I just thought that I'd share
a link to a [slashdot article](http://slashdot.org/articles/04/10/15/1735207.shtml?tid=198&tid=137) about a hard drive my brother [Peter](http://peter.wagstrom.net/) worked on for Seagate.  Here is a little picture
to see this nice little 2.5 inch SCSI drive.
