Patrick Wagstrom's Academic Home Page
=====================================

Welcome to my home page and aggregator for academic information
related to me. This is that place if you're looking for information on
my research on software engineering, open source software development,
and social network analysis. If you're looking for information on
technology policy, MythTV and HDTV, or my random rants about using
Linux as a desktop operating system, you probably want to see my
personal home page, or my weblog. If you're wondering about where I've
worked in the past and business type stuff, you should probably check
out my LinkedIn profile.  If you're a friend, I finally gave in and
created a Facebook profile.

Primary Academic Interests
--------------------------

I'm interested in the complex interactions required to make
distributed software development and engineering processes work. There
isn't any magical pixie dust that allows Open Source communities to
create high quality software, rather its a blend of norms and
processes that allow developers to collaborate effectively with
minimal amounts of communication. When firms and individuals start to
enter these communities, dramatic shifts in the organization of the
community occur, sometimes with disastrous consequences -- so we must
learn more about these interactions. Particularly, I take a
hierarchical view to distributed Open Source communities, looking at
the foundations, firms, and individuals in each community and how they
collaborate. As I've researched these topics more and more, I've
realized that many of these same challenges are inherent in any
distributed team, so I also seek to bridge the knowledge about the
Open Source world to the other realms.

Academic Background
-------------------

Like many students at Carnegie Mellon, I have a fairly
interdisciplinary background. When I arrived at Carnegie Mellon, I
joined the Department of Engineering and Public Policy in the College
of Engineering. Later, when the new program in Computation,
Organizations, and Society was created within the Institute for
Software Research in the School of Computer Science, I joined that
program, where I now pursue a joint Ph.D. between the two programs. I
am currently affiliated with two different research groups at Carnegie
Mellon, the Center for the Computational Analysis of Social and
Organizational Systems and the Carnegie Mellon Software Industry
Center. Trust me, it all works out and makes me a well rounded
researcher. It also gives me a lot of flair to put on my home page and
business cards.

Before arriving at Carnegie Mellon, I obtained a master's degree in
computer science from Illinois Institute of Technology. I also have
three undergraduate degrees, in computer science, computer
engineering, and electrical engineering from Illinois Institute of
Technology.

Research Collaborators
----------------------

Over the course of my academic career I've had the privilege of
collaborating with lots of extremely talented and gifted
individuals. Here's a small selection of great folks I've worked with
and a little blurb of what I'm doing or did with them.  If you're
someone I've worked with and I've forgotten you, please let me know
and I'll try to remedy the situation.

Teaching and Research Supervision
---------------------------------
While at Illinois Institute of Technology I served for three years as
a teaching assistant - working as a lab TA, then lab manager, and
finally working with Dr. Xian-He Sun to implement a graduate level
course on pervasive computing.  In addition, I proposed and managed an
Interprofessional Project on applications of pervasive computing.
This project had me working and managing 12 of the brightest
undergraduates on an innovative project to utilize wireless technology
in the classroom, at a time when wireless networks were far from
common.  This project continued as an in-depth research project over
the summer where I supervised three undergraduates on their first
research experience: Tyler Butler (now at Microsoft), Andrei Makhanov
(on leave from the Ph.D. program in electrical engineering at
Northwestern to work at Powerset), and Brent Lagesse (received a
Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Arlington, now at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory).  

At Carnegie Mellon I have worked with two other graduate students, two
faculty members, and 20 students on addressing the wide open problem
of spyware.  I directed the technical students on an ambitious and
successful project that involved monitoring all of the Carnegie Mellon
internet traffic for traces of spyware using Snort.  I also worked
closely with a group of students attempting an educational
intervention on spyware and assisted their design of an experiment.
The results of this successful project were later presented to
officials from the Federal Trade Commision, congressional staffers,
America Online, and the computing services staff at Carnegie Mellon.

I have also had the opportunity to give numerous guest lectures in
undergraduate and graduate classes on diverse topics such as the
interplay of HDTV and Digital Rights Management, social networks and
the Internet, and designing Open Source Software.  These experiences
have been augmented by training sessions at the Eberly Center for
Teaching Excellence and a two year seminar series on preparing for a
career in faculty.

Academic Service
----------------
I've reviewed papers for a variety of conferences and journals,
including CHI, CSCW, IEEE Transactions on Security and Privacy, and
IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering. I've also been on the
organizing committee for CSCW 2004 (Computing Chair), CSCW 2008
(Computing and A/V Co-Chair), and CSCW 2011 (Computing and A/V Chair)
and served as a student volunteer at CSCW 2006.
