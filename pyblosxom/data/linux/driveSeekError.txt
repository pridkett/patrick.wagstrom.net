Fixing Some Longstanding Problems

I finally got around to fixing some long standing problems with my computer today.  First among them was the problem that I had been having with the following
errors for the last four or five years:

<pre>Mar 03 08:21:35 dreams kernel: hdc: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
Mar 03 08:21:35 dreams kernel: hdc: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
</pre>
<p>
I had this problem since my K6-200.  It eventually caused me to buy a new hard disk for that computer and set up some funky raid stuff because I thought I
was loosing data.  Turns out I probably wasn't.  Anyway, this problem is the
result of a bad IDE cable.  So it's a hardware problem.  I probably just
moved the IDE cable when I switched from one computer to another.  I found
out that I had a spare 80 pin IDE (as opposed to that 40 pin IDE cable) so
I plopped it in and it works like a charm.  Also of interest is the nice
speedup that I got from it.

Also managed to go through and make it so my computer boots better.  It had been a little flunk since upgrading the bios this past weekend.  All that was
in an attempt to get my computer to sleep better.  Which won't work because I don't have a wake on lan cable.  So, if you've got one that you want to give
to me or sell for cheap, let me know.  I'd be thankful as it would cut down
my power bill if I could shutdown the PC when I wasn't using it.
