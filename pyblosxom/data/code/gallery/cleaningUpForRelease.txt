Cleaning up for a preliminary release

<!-- Date: 2004-05-28 14:28 -->
<p>
I'm in the process of cleaning up my gallery software for an initial
release and posting to <a href="http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>.
Mainly this consists of moving stuff into different files, and putting
credits on the files.  However, this has introduced the need to watch
how I was implementing some things as the original proof of concept was
nothing more than one 500 line python script.  This meant that everything
was in the same namespace, which shouldn't be.

In any case, with the holiday weekend, I'll probably have a bit of time
to set up the project over at SourceForge and then I'll post more details
about it over there.
