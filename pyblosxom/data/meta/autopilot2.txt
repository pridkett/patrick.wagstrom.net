Almost on Autopilot

So I lied about the complete autopilot.  I just gotta do a shout-out to IBM's
service division and how much they rock.  My laptop started to go on the fritz
on Friday morning.  On saturday I called them and was informed that my main
board was probably dead.  A box showed up Tuesday for me to send the laptop
back in, and the fixed laptop was returned today.  That's amazing.  Not even
a 48 hour turnaround for repair.  I'm very impressed.
