During the cold war many "citizens" of totalitarian states were required to
carry identification papers and show them on demand to authorities.  This
action was oestensibly done to check for criminals, but in reality the rulers
of these nations had something more insidious in mind.  They accurately released
that making the citizenry live in fear of the police was a wonderful way to
keep everyone under control.

Fast forward to 2005 and America is heading in the same direction.  In September
[Deboarah Davis](http://www.papersplease.org/davis/) was riding
the bus to work in Denver.  A police officer came on the bus, asked for
everyone's ID on the bus, and had Mrs. Davis, a 50 yr old middle class mother
of three, thrown in jail on federal charges.  This is not my America, and this
insanity has to stop now.   Make a call to your reps and senators today and
tell them that you're concerned about how America's freedom is becoming a
permission society where the government dictates what route we can take to work,
what planes we can fly, and what trains we can ride.  What next?  What roads
we're allowed to drive on?
