The Sacramento Bee has a good <a
href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/opinion/story/7837475p-8778055c.html">opinon
article</a> written by a county clerk/recorder and UC-Davis Law School faculty
member that explain some of the big programs behind the Help America Vote Act
and why all these touch screen devices are bad news.  It catalogs the big three
e-voting companies and how none of them deserve your trust.  I highly recommend
it.
