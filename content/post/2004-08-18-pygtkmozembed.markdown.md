So rather than doing work today, I decided to write a nice little tutorial on
how to use [PyGTKMoz](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygtkmoz).
It is basically a mirror of Erik Dasque's [similar C# tutorial](http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html).






But that was only half the fun.  In true overkill style I felt that I had to
create my own XML dialect for this little project to automatically number
figures, create hyperlinks, and do all sorts of other fun stuff.  So, as
a result, there is an xml and html version.






Without further delay I present: [Creating a GNOME Web Browser with Python](/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.html) or the [XML version if you like](/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.xml).
