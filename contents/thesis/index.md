Ph.D. Thesis
------------
<a name="phdthesis"></a>

The title of my thesis is "Vertical Interaction in Open Software Engineering Communities".  My committee consists of [James D. Herbsleb][herbsleb] ([Institute for Software Research][isr] at [CMU][cmu], co-chair), [Kathleen Carley][carley] ([Computations, Organizations, and Society][cos] at CMU, co-chair), [Audris Mockus][mockus] ([Avaya][avaya]), and [M. Granger Morgan][morgan] ([Engineering and Public Policy][epp] at CMU). It was submitted as part of the requirements for both a Ph.D. in [Engineering and Public Policy][epp] from the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and also a Ph.D. in [Computation, Organizations, and Society][cos] in the College of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. So, it is a dual Ph.D. (not a two Ph.D.s).

My thesis defense took place on March 9, 2009.  For posterity's sake, I've preserved [Patrick's awesome thesis defense page][defense].

Master of Science Thesis
------------------------
<a name="msthesis"></a>

[Department of Computer Science][iit-cs] at [Illinois Institute of Technology][iit].  My committee was [Xian-He Sun][sun] and [Gady Agam][agam].  Despite the very large number of Master of Science degrees that IIT awards in computer science, very few students write a thesis.

My Master's thesis is titled "Scarlet: A Framework for Context Aware Computing".

My thesis defense took place on July 16, 2003.
