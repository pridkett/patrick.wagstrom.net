This is more or less the final screen shot of the finished version of <A HREF="../themes/index.shtml">Esotherix</A>, my WindowMaker theme.  It not longer requires you to modify rgb.txt.  You can also see my leet-0 <A HREF="../linux/tcshrc.html">color prompts</A> and <A HREF="../vim/index.shtml">VIM syntax highlighting</A>.  Oh yeah, I also got <A HREF="http://www.internetter.com/titan/mess/">MESS</A> running a genesis.
