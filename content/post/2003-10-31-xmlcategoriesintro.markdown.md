In the spirit of making every damn thing on this site XML, I went through and translated
the category plugin into XML spitting out fun.  It's not quite perfect yet as it doesn't
nest XML elements, but it works well enough to generate a simple list.  You can see it
in action (post XSLT processing of course) on the side of this weblog.  Feel free to
download it from my [projects page](/projects).
