PyWifiApplet

Frustrated by the fact that <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> doesn't ship with NetApplet or
NetworkManager?  Me too!  In the true open source spirit, I've chosen
to get off my ass actually do something about it.  Behold, the first
screenshot of PyWifiApplet.  This little bugger sits on your gnome
panels and tells you what network you're connected to.  It's as
simple as just pulling up a menu to switch networks.  Can it get much
easier?  Well, yeah, it could detect the network switch automagically,
which is probably the next task.

Unfortunately, it's going to be a few more days until I get a chance
to clean up this thing and release it.  It makes use of the very handy
<a href="http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/pywifi/">pywifi</a> and the
python bindings for <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">dbus</a>
which allow communication to the server process that watches the network
configuration.  I think it might be a little debian specific right now, my
goal is to change that in the near future.

On a related Ubuntu note, I opened up my mail today to find that I had
received a package from Switzerland.  Thinking it was Anthrax, I was tempted
to have my wife open it, but she refused.  I was pleased to see a nice stack
of Ubuntu CDs.  I'll go to the LUG meeting in a few weeks and give them
away there.
