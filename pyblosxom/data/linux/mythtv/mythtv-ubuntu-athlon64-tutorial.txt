MythTV, Ubuntu, Athlon64, WinTVPVR, Comcast Digital Cable, and a pcHDTV HD-3000 in a pear tree!

<!-- Date: 2005-11-17 11:08 -->
<p>
I've been writing a nice <a href="/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml">tutorial on setting up
MythTV on Ubuntu x86_64</a> over the course of the past few weeks.  Please feel free to browse
it and give feedback.  It still is a work in progress and I could certainly use some help in
some spots.  I should clarify this by explaining that I've got my system more or less working,
with the exception of static on my pcHDTV which I understand is an electro-magnetic interference issue that
I can't do anything about.  When I move that card into another computer, I'll add details about
that too.

<p>
For those that are concerned, I'll eventually put up a TRAC site for managing the project and
and providing access to the repository of revisions.  My goal is to provide a slightly more up-to-date
and <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> centric version of <a href="http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/">Jarod
Wilson's Fedora MythTV Guide</a>.  I know, that's a lot of hoping.  Come on magic
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_juice">google juice</a>, lead people to me.
