"""
The end of the PyBlosxom request lifecycle involves rendering the 
entries we've decided we want to render.  This is the job of the
renderers.  They handle pulling in templates, expanding variables,
formatting entries into stories, and then outputting it to stdout
(or wherever) for final output.

Creating a new renderer involves dropping a new module in this
directory and adjusting your config file to use your new module.
