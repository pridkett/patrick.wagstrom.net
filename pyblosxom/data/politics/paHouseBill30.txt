Pennsylvania House Bill 30

<p>
Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/ALL/2003/0/HB0030.HTM">House Bill 30</a> is currently making it's way through the Senate in the
state of Pennsylvania.  It seems like it's a good thing, ecouraging investment
in broadband, supporting voice over IP, and that sort of stuff.  But a closer
read shows the whole think smacks of corporate interests.  In particular,
Section 3014, Subsection H (page 70 of the current version as of right now,
PN 4778) has the following:
</p>
<pre>
 3   (H) PROHIBITION AGAINST POLITICAL SUBDIVISION ADVANCED AND  
 4 BROADBAND SERVICES DEPLOYMENT.--  
 5     (1) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR UNDER PARAGRAPH  
 6   (2), A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OR ANY ENTITY ESTABLISHED BY A  
 7   POLITICAL SUBDIVISION MAY NOT PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC FOR  
 8   COMPENSATION ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING  
 9   ADVANCED AND BROADBAND SERVICES, WITHIN THE SERVICE TERRITORY  
10   OF A LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OPERATING  
11   UNDER A NETWORK MODERNIZATION PLAN.  
12     (2) A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION MAY OFFER ADVANCED OR  
13   BROADBAND SERVICES IF THE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION HAS SUBMITTED  
14   A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH SERVICE TO THE  
15   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY SERVING THE AREA  
16   AND, WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST, THE LOCAL  
17   EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES  
18   HAS NOT AGREED TO PROVIDE THE DATA SPEEDS REQUESTED. IF THE  
19   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OR ONE OF ITS  
20   AFFILIATES AGREES TO PROVIDE THE DATA SPEEDS REQUESTED, THEN  
21   IT MUST DO SO WITHIN 14 MONTHS OF RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST.  
22     (3) THE PROHIBITION IN PARAGRAPH (1) SHALL NOT BE  
23   CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE THE CONTINUED PROVISION OR OFFERING OF  
24   TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE  
25   SAME TYPE AND SCOPE AS WERE BEING PROVIDED ON THE EFFECTIVE  
26   DATE OF THIS SECTION.

This would effectively kill <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20040901-4149.html">Philadelphia's WiFi Plan</a>.  Why?  Because it's bad news to
Verizon who would actually have to compete.  I see nothing wrong with a 
"political subdivision" providing broadband services.  After all, if it's a
free market, the local exchange companies would just have to provide better
service.  But I guess we all know that service and local exchange don't go
together.  Anyway, I called <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?districtnumber=38">my state senator</a> about this already this morning.
The person who answered the phone was very helpful (much better than the 
people I get at the federal level).  Let's hope my phone call makes a
difference.  If I understand the current standing of the bill correctly, all that needs to be done is approval by
the senate and then a signature from Governor Rendell.  If you're in PA and
get a chance, try to call today.
