Putting Money Where Our Mouths Are

Kristina and I sat down and spent some time today figuring out how everything
was going to work out, it looks like it might actually work out.  Unfortunately
the cruise that I thought existed really doesn't.  So we're looking at a cruise
that goes to Key West, Grand Cayman and Cozumel.  We're also still looking at
getting PADI certified ahead of time or possibly on the cruise depending.  I
gotta call the travel agency later this week.
