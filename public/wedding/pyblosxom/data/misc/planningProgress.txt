Lots of Progress Made

From March 9th to the 16th both of us were in Texas and we did a lot of
various little wedding planning things.  Some were quick, some were not.  Here
is a rough list of what we got accomplished.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Met with Pastor for first session</li>
<li>Registered for Tuxedos</li>
<li>Ordered Invitations</li>
<li>Picked up stuff to make sample centerpieces</li>
<li>Figured out what flowers we wanted to order</li>
<li>Bought our wedding rings</li>
<li>Registered for gifts</li>
<li>Reserved a hotel room for us</li>
<li>Found some ideas for hotel rooms for other people</li>
<li>Looked up information about limo companies</li>
<li>Picked out wedding vows</li>
<li>Decided on wedding music</li>
</ul>
<p>
And probably a decent amount of other stuff that I've forgotten.  It's looking
good because on all of the wedding checklists we're about where we're supposed
to be.  Some things are much easier because we don't have a ring bearer and that
sort of stuff.  Anyway, I'll post more later I guess.
