No Church?  No Problem!

Do you want to get married in the middle of the Sahara Desert but you can't because there isn't a church?  Not a problem anymore, simply get the <a href="http://www.inflatablechurch.com/">Inflatable Church</a> and be on your merry way.  You still have the whole problem of pumping the massive 47ft x 25ft x 47 ft structure full of air.  But you've got a church, and in mere minutes, compared to the hundreds of years for some of the more grandiose European cathedrals.
