Today I went and registered the gallery software over at source forge, and with
that I also named the software, it's going to be called PennAve, which is a
street by my house.  I figure that is better than pyDynaPhotoXMLGallery or
whatever other stupid name most people give to projects.  I'm working on
getting it installed on this server and will post a link to the demo when it's
ready.
