During the nascent era of the Linux desktop it was quite popular to post
screenshots of what your desktop looked like. This was a great way to show
not only the changes that were happening on the underlying platform, but
also discover interesting new apps that you might not have known about.

As you can see below, I took frequent screenshots of my desktop while I was
in college. In many cases I would try to make the desktop look busier than
it really was. It's also interesting because it shows that nearly twenty years
later, I still use some of these same programs on a daily basis.
