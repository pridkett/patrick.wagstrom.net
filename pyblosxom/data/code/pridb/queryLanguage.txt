PriDB Query Language Intro

<p>
This is a brief introduction to what I'm thinking for PriDB's query langauage.  It's a weird mixture of SQL and XPATH right now, so
you kinda need to know both.  The most simple request will look something like this:
</p>
<pre>SELECT "//*" FROM documentName</pre>
<p>
Such a query is equal to the more conventional:
</p>
<pre>SELECT * FROM tableName</pre>
<p>
Except that it will select each node in the document instead of each row in the table.  Now you can also apply your usual modifiers
to a query like you can in SQL.  For instance you can execute a query like this:
</p>
<pre>SELECT DISTINCT "//*" FROM documentName LIMIT 3</pre>
<p>
This will return the first three distinct elements in the return set to the user.  On the down side, I don't know a nice way in XPATH
to say only return the first three.  For instance, if you only want the first element in an XPATH query you'd use something like <my:verbatim>//*[1]</my:verbatim>,
but you can't change that to <my:verbatim>//*[1-5]</my:verbatim>.  All the references that I've found to limiting ask you use to XSLT
to limit.  Which is fine and dandy, but not the way I want to do it right now.
</p>
<p>
Another interesting note is that where clauses don't exist in this modified version of SQL, at least not right now, I may add them later.
Right now the entire where clause must be specified in the XPATH identifier.  For instance to get all nodes unique nodes that have an
attribute called <my:verbatim>name</my:verbatim> with a value of <my:verbatim>simpleName</my:verbatim> you would run the following
query:
</p>
<pre>SELECT DISTINCT "//*[@name='simpleName']" FROM testDocument
</pre>
