Stopping Spam With Postfix

<!-- Date: 2002-11-06 18:13 -->
<p>
So today my <a href="http://peter.wagstrom.net/">brother</a> asked me to block a couple of domain names that were spamming him.  I didn't know how to in postfix, luckily for me <a href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, my mailer daemon, has some pretty good support for anti-spam measures.  I'll detail two things that I did today:
<br />
<br />
First I put the following lines in my /etc/postfix/main.cf file:

<pre>
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
disable_vrfy_command = yes
smtpd_banner = $myhostname NO UCE ESMTP

smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,
       reject_unauth_destination,
       check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/sender_access
</pre>

The first line allows the system to perform some automagic header checking on the message.  The second line disables the VRFY command in the daemon so spammers can't glean addresses from it.  The third just adds a string that says "NO UCE" on the hello banner.  There have been laws passed around that say if you have that they can't send spam.  Of course no one probably listens.  The final one denies access to users when they execute the "MAIL FROM" command if they are bad.
<br /><br />
So here is the contents of my /etc/postfix/header_checks:
<pre>
# Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
#for other domains.
/[%!@].*@/                              550 Sender-specified routing rejected

# Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix their problem.
/^postmaster@.*$/                       OK

# Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
/^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/!/^owner-.*/      550 Use ${1}@${2} instead

# And banned domains
/^From:(.*)@anfmail\.com$/              REJECT
/^From:(.*)@bijouline\.com$/            REJECT
/^From:(.*)@dreamwiz\.com$/             REJECT
/^From:(.*)@hanmail\.net$/              REJECT
/^From:(.*)@hitel\.net$/                REJECT
/^From:(.*)@kbsgmp\.com$/               REJECT
/^From:(.*)@korea\.com$/                REJECT
/^From:(.*)@naver\.com$/                REJECT
/^From:(.*)@nowmusic\.co\.kr$/          REJECT
/^From:(.*)@resumestorm\.com$/          REJECT
/^From:(.*)@salsakiss\.com$/            REJECT
</pre>

And here is the contents of my /etc/postfix/sender_access:
<pre>
# domains that bring spam

anfmail.com     554 Spammer
bijouline.com   554 Spammer
dreamwiz.com    554 Spammer
example.com     554 Mail from example domains not accepted.
hanmail.net     554 Spammer
in-addr.arpa    554 Mail from example domains not accepted.
kbsgmp.com      554 Spammer
korea.com       554 Spammer
naver.com       554 Spammer
nowmusic.co.kr  554 Spammer
public.com      554 Mail from example domains not accepted.
resumestorm.com 554 Spammer
salsakiss.com   554 Spammer

# Particular addresses that are bring lots of spam

anonymous@      554 Mail from anonymous is always spam.
</pre>

Then run "/usr/local/sbin/postmap sender_access" and restart postfix and you should be on your way.  Your paths may vary also.  In addition the domains are not all of the spammers.  I get lots more, they are just more habitual ones that I have to deal with.  If you run an ISP don't can their accounts just because of me.  I also run SpamAssasin on my local box that gleans the mail from my server and my school account.  Hope this helps someone.
