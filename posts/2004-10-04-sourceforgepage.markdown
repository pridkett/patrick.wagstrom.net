I'm pleased to say that Mono.ReadLine now has a page on
[SourceForge](http://mono-readline.sourceforge.net/)
and also has a record on
[FreshMeat](http://freshmeat.net/projects/monoreadline/).
I guess this means that my little repackaging is now officially
submitted to the open source world.  If I get a chance I'll make
a record on [Advogato](http://www.advogato.org/).
