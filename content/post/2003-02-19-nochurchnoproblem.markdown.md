Do you want to get married in the middle of the Sahara Desert but you can't because there isn't a church?  Not a problem anymore, simply get the [Inflatable Church](http://www.inflatablechurch.com/) and be on your merry way.  You still have the whole problem of pumping the massive 47ft x 25ft x 47 ft structure full of air.  But you've got a church, and in mere minutes, compared to the hundreds of years for some of the more grandiose European cathedrals.
