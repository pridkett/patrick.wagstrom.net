Break out your pens my freedom loving friends and write your senator.  It seems
that it is illegal for me to modify a piece of hardware that I own.  That's
right, today the USDOJ siezed control of
[isonews.com](http://www.isonews.com/).  The owner had been selling mod chips
that allow people to play any game on their XBox.  The DOJ has a [press
release](http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2003/February/03_crm_118.htm) online about
the whole thing.

Here is what bugs me about this.  I don't own an X-Box, and we'll skip the part
about how I think people who own an X-Box should be thrown in jail.  That
aside, this is a lot like making a VCR illegal as that allows you to play any
movie over and over again without renting it again.  But it also has legitimate
purposes.  The Enigmah mod-chips he was selling allowed you to play back ups
and any region DVDs.  This is hardly illegal.  I've got a few old CDRom games
for PC that are all scratched up and no longer playable, if I had been really
worried, I could have burned copies of them.  Pretty straight forward.  But
apparently, giving people the ability to do that is now illegal.
