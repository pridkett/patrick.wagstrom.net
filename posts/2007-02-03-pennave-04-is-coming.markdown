I'm almost to the point where I'm ready to do a push out of the new 0.4 release of PennAve.  This release sees lots of new features and bug fixes that make the software even better.  Most of all, it's got a UI that's 83.6% sexier than the previous version, all at the same great free cost. It seems like most everything is working now, there are a few large known bugs that I'm not sure if they'll get fixed before the release.  They currently are:

  * [slideshow does not work in IE 7](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1651523&group_id=110753&atid=657348)
  * [possible to leak information about tags](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1651525&group_id=110753&atid=657348)
  * [images should have alt tags](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1651528&group_id=110753&atid=657348)

The astute observer will notice that there are a few other bugs also listed on the [bug tracker page for PennAve](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=657348&group_id=110753&func=browse). These are fairly minor UI bugs that I'm not going to worry about fixing right now. If I get the chance, I'll see about tackling them, but they're not real high priority.  Also, I'm sucky at design.

So, if you're feeling adventurous, hop on over to [my web photo gallery](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/) and tell me if you see anything wrong.  Bugs can be submitted on SourceForge.net, or through an email to me.
