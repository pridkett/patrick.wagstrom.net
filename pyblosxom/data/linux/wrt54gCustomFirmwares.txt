Custom Firmware for the WRT54G

I just noticed that James Ewing has a some <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html">custom firmware for the WRT54G</a> on his website.  I think I'll mess
around with some of these this weekend.  They've got all the features of the
newest LinkSys firmware and have some additional stuff so it's SSHable and
what not.  Pretty smooth.
