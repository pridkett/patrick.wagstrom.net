I discovered <a href="http://www.fellowship911.com/">Fellowship 9/11</a> today.
It's humorous, especially if you tend to think that Michael Moore may be full
of poo.  Also, whats really cool that <a href="http://mplayerplug-in.sourceforge.net/">mplayerplug-in</a> lets it play just fine in Linux.  Yay for video
and stuff.  Also, and upgraded version of a <a href="http://www.real.com/linux/">Real Player for Linux</a> seems to handle it fine.  I suggest going for the
QuickTime stream as Mplayerplug-in lets you save it for later.  Like bubble
gum on the bedpost overnight.

Also, this post further highlights my problems with needed a better blogging
system than Pyblosxom.  I'm sure there have been other MLP like posts in my
blog, but I don't remember where I put them and couldn't decided where to
put this, so I just made a new category.
