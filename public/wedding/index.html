So, we'll start out with the important stuff.  Kristina and Patrick started
dating in November of 2001.  We were engaged on October 17th, 2003 and were
married on July 10th, 2004 at Palm Valley Lutheran Church in Round
Rock, Texas.
</p>
<p>
During the engagement we had a sparadoically updated <a href="/weblog/">weblog</a> where we put some comments, but it didn't get used as much as we hoped.  Now that the wedding is over, you can check out all sorts of photos from the <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/photos/wedding/">wedding</a> and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/photos/honeymoon/">honeymoon</a>.  In addition, my parents have <a href="http://wesandlaura.wagstrom.net/gallery/patandkristina/">a whole
bunch of pictures</a> online that were taken with their cameras.
