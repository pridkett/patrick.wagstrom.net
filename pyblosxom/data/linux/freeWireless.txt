Steps to Free Wireless In Linux

Here are the steps one can take to get free wireless in Linux.  As long as the
network isn't encrypted this should work.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Install and configure <a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net/">Kismet</a>.</li>
<li>Sniff traffic to find open access points.</li>
<li>If an open access point is not available, then sniff for MAC addresses.
<ol>
<li>Modify your driver to force your MAC address to that of an existing client</li>
<li>Make sure to write down your old address.</li>
<li>Install the modified driver.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Enjoy your newfound wireless access.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note, I'm doing the former, not the latter (i.e. I'm on an open access point).
If you get really ambitious, it might be possible to hack a WRT54G to do this
for you.  That would be fun.

<b>Update:</b> As a quick Googling found, there is no reason to recompile
your driver as long as it supports setting the hardware address.  To do this,
before you bring up the device run <my:verbose>ifconfig eth0 hw ether 01:02:03:04:05:06</my:verbose>.  More information is <a href="http://www.talvi.net/notes/mac-spoofing.html">available here</a>.   I have not tried this, nor do I
advocate this, but it's just something cool I think you can do.
