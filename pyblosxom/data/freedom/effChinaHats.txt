Where is my EFF Hat Made?

I'm a proud supporter of the
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> at a level that is probably much higher
than my income should support.  But in general, their work is really valuable
and I appreciate all that they do.  Last year when I made my donation, I
even got some nifty schwag to go with it, a nice EFF Swat Hat, as seen below.

It sat unused for well over a year, as I had a nice bucket hat that would get
worn when I was outside for extended periods.  I really liked that hat.  I had
owned it for about five or six years.  It was broken in.  It had history.  It
fit <a href="/weblog/politics/myEnormousMelon.xml">my enormous melon</a>.  Unfortunately,
due to the ineptitude of United/Lufthansa/Air Dolomiti in delivering my
luggage to me in Genoa last month (or in Pittsburgh this month), it appears
my beloved bucket hat is taking a permanent vacation in
the Munich or Frankfurt airports.  Initially I thought this was not going
to be a huge problem as I don't wear hats that often.  But then something
different came up, baseball and tailgating with Kristina's department.  I
needed a hat.  Seeing the only hat that I owned, I threw it on.

It actually was kinda cool, lots of folks asked about the EFF and I was able
to tell them a little bit about what the EFF does.  Usually they just shrugged
and walked off, probably thinking "this guy is a geek".  Whatever, they're
chemical engineers.   Anyway, I did some examination of the tag and this
is what I found:

Made where?  In China?!  Maybe this hit me on my bad side or something.  I
really don't like China.  I don't like how they abuse their citizens.  I don't
like how they're communist.  I don't like their cheap products.  In most
cases I'm even willing to pay a decent premium to avoid buying Chinese products.
Furthermore, if one <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeff.org+china">queries Dr. Google</a> you get a lot of links the EFF's site, almost of none
of them good.  China engages in draconian censorship and supression of free
speech.  I can't believe that the EFF would support them like this (don't
delude yourself, any piece of <a href="http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/archives/001654.html">cheap chinese shit</a> you buy supports communism).

As the activist the armchair activist that I've become, I did what came natural,
an email off to the EFF information address.  In the past I've gotten quick
responses on issues to this address.  This was sent a few weeks ago, and I have
yet to receive a response.  Even a terse message like  "we have no policy
toward China." would be welcome.

Hi,

About a year ago I received an EFF "SWAT" hat as shwag for my membership
donation to the EFF.  I really haven't worn the hat all that much, in
fact this weekend was the first time.  I took a close look at the label
and saw that it was made in China.  Now, I don't think that I'm some
sort of anti-China nutcase, but I believe there is an issue with an
organization like the EFF, that promotes freedom on the net, supporting
products from a nation that works so hard to censor the net and keep
controls on information.  Is China not one of the most oppressive
regimes when it comes to information dissemination?

Does the EFF have a policy about using products or goods from China?

Thanks,

Maybe one of my readers with better connections will have better luck getting
to the bottom of this.
