I'm sure this has got to be a violation of some sort of law, probably related
the FERPA.  I got this email from some random people outside of IIT today:

    Hello,

    Welcome! You have been registered in your university/college ELMS
    for MSDNAA online software system. Here you can download and
    access a wide range of Microsoft developer tools, servers, and
    platforms. There is no charge to download the software as long
    as you are an eligible user in the System.

    How Does it Work?

    Your university/college is licensed under the MSDN Academic
    Alliance Program which enables eligible students and faculty
    members to access software available under the Program. e-academy
    Inc., a partner of Microsoft, is providing ELMS for MSDNAA to you.
    Simply log into the System using your username and password
    included below and start browsing/ordering the software
    available to you.

    Your MSDNAA Online Software System can be found at:
    http://msdn03.e-academy.com/iit_cs

The mail goes one for a few more paragraphs and even has my username and
password in plaintext.  This is a problem in several ways.  First of all, this
data is a marketing gold mine for e-academy or whoever.  Knowing that not only
are these people college students, but they also are computer science graduate
students can be worth a lot of money.  Furthermore they can track what software
students use to a greater degree than I think anyone would like to admit.

I'm just really pissed off that my university would distribute my information
in such a way.  It makes me wonder what other sort of information they have
given away (I use that term because the MSDNAA program costs money).  I have no
intention of using the software and will not participate in the program.  I
need to go bitch at a real person I guess.
