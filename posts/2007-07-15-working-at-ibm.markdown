After my last post I got a few emails from folks saying that they didn't know what I was up to now-a-days.  I'm currently working for IBM Research in Hawthorne, NY (just outside of NYC), in their IT Governance group. In other words, I'm doing similar things at IBM that I've been doing for my thesis research for the last few years.  I'll be in the NYC area until at least the end of August.  If you're visiting, let me know.
