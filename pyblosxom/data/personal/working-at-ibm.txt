I'm Working at IBM Research

<!-- Date: 2007-07-15 00:01 -->
<p>
After my last post I got a few emails from folks saying that they didn't
know what I was up to now-a-days.  I'm currently working for IBM Research
in Hawthorne, NY (just outside of NYC), in their IT Governance group.
In other words, I'm doing similar things at IBM that I've been doing for
my thesis research for the last few years.  I'll be in the NYC area until
at least the end of August.  If you're visiting, let me know.
