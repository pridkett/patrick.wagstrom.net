title: GCC Crashes My Computer

Anyone know of a reason why [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/) would
sometimes crash my computer while compiling?  More specifically, it seems
related to large projects.  I had the problem several times while compiling
Gentoo over the weekend (one of the major factors that made me go back to
using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/)).  Last night I
experienced the problem while recompiling
[MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) so I could enjoy XRandR and
[LIRC](http://www.lirc.org/) support.






Also, I'm experiencing some weird problems with JFS related issues.  One
very strange thing about the file system is that it goes read-only when it
detects a consistency error.  I had several of these last night, on both
of my JFS partitions.  Needless to say, it took me a while to figure out what
was going on.  One of the files caused the JFS tools to segfault and die.
Which meant that I really couldn't fix it.  Sigh...Did I mention that I
really hate computers some days?
