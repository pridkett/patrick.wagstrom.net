Freenet

I've been playing around with the <a href="http://www.freenetproject.org/">FreeNet Project</a> over the past night as part of an assignment examining peer to peer systems.  I'm pretty impressed with it so far.  It does take some time for your system to build up it's routing tables, but overall it's pretty cool.  I managed insert my first piece of work into the freenet today.  You can find it using freenet:KSK@fiction/chipless as your URL.  Otherwise you can just go to <a href="http://localhost:8888/KSK@fiction/chipless">http://localhost:8888/KSK@fiction/chipless</a> to get it (you need to have fproxy running though).  I need to do some work because it requests images from other sources and has non-freenet links.  Maybe for another time.
