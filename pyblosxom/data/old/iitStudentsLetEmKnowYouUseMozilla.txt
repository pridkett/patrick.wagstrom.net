IIT Students, Let 'Em Know You Use Mozilla

<!-- Date: 2002-11-22 10:43 -->
<p>
The <a href="http://iit.ecollege.com/">IIT Course Evaluation Site</a> does not currently support Mozilla.  Let them know that you use Mozilla and would like it to be supported.  Email <a href="mailto:evaluation@iit.edu">evaluation@iit.edu</a> and <a href="techsupport@realed.com">techsupport@realed.com</a> and ask them to support Mozilla based browsers.  Here is the email that I just sent.

As a person who cares both about my personal security and the quality of
my software, I am more than a little surprised at your lack of support
for Mozilla based browsers on the IIT evaluation site.  Despite the fact
that it has been shown that Mozilla (the engine on which newer netscape
browsers are based) is the most robust and standards compliant web
browser available.  Even looking at the chart I am referred to at:

<a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/</a>



it inidicates that Mozilla 1.0 and 1.1 support all of the features that
would be required of an HTML page.  This leaves people who use Unix
based systems in a quandry.  Either downgrade their software, or use a
buggy commercial browser (see <a href="http://www.iit.edu/~wagspat/exploittest.html">http://www.iit.edu/~wagspat/exploittest.html</a>)
that has the possibility to execute code without my asking.

I would like to know the reason for the lack of support for Mozilla
based browsers.

Thank You,
