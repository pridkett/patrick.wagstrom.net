That's right!  Just when I thought it would never get published a book shows
up for me today in the office.  Right there in chapter 5 is what I wrote.
It's a little strange because it has three different affiliations listed for
me, Argonne National Lab, Illinois Institute of Technology, and Carnegie
Mellon Univeristy.  Anyway, go [buy a copy](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471332887.html) or just ask to borrow mine.
