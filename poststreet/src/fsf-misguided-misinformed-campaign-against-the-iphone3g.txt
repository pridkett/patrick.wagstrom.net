The Free Software Foundation's Misguided and Misinformed Campaign Against the iPhone 3G
<!-- Date: 2008-07-31 14:20 -->

<p> The <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> has
done some truly amazing things for computers.  The creation of Emacs,
GCC, most of the standard Linux utilities, and the genesis of the
ideas that later created Open Source (although, Stallman despises it),
are just a few of the important things they've done.  They generally fight
the good fight and make the computer world a better place to be.  </p>
<p> However, over the past few years, something seems to have changed
within the Free Software Foundation.  With the rise of DRM the Free
Software Foundation began to organize vocal protests against systems
that enabled content providers to protect their creations -- after
all, Free software doesn't need such protections.  <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3098">Activists in
haz-mat suits</a> could be seen at product launches for Windows Vista, at
the Virgin Megastore, and lots of other places where they thought they
could get attention.  Always handing out little stickers explaining
the problems with DRM.  In fact, for a very long time, I've had a <a
href="http://thomashawk.com/2006/10/ipod-itunes-drm-defective-by-design.html">defective
by design sticker</a> on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
Of course, this was 2006 and times were very different back then.
There weren't any stores to purchase non-DRM'd music, now it seems you
can purchase it everywhere, so the whole DRM'd music issue is a bit
more moot now.  Instead, the Defective by Design campaign has chosen
to focus on any system that enables DRM.  Well, I shouldn't say any
system that enables, just some systems -- in particular the iPhone
3G.  In their latest effort, Defective by Design has been actively
encouraging people to <a
href="http://defectivebydesign.org/apple-challenge">book times at
Apple Genius bars to harass employees and customers</a>.  First, let's
look at the five claims they make about the iPhone 3G:
</p>
<p>
<b>1. iPhone completely blocks free software. Developers must pay a tax to
Apple, who becomes the sole authority over what can and can’t be on
everyone’s phones.</b>
</p>
<p>
This is partially true.  It does cost money to become an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">official
iPhone developer</a>, but the amount is actually quite small, $99.  There is also
the little annoyance of the current <a
href="http://www.fuckingnda.com/">NDA on the developer kit</a> that
also restricts what developers can do, although it is expected to be
lifted soon.  However, it fails on a couple of points.  First, if
you're an iPhone developer, you can run any application you develop on
your iPhone and those of 4 other people.  Once the beta system comes
you'll be able to distribute to 100 other people.  For small scale
distribution this is pretty good.  And second, and perhaps bigger,
there is always the option of <a href="http://lifehacker.com/398906/jailbreak-iphone-20-with-pwnagetool">jailbreaking your phone</a> to run whatever
the heck you want.  If you want to develop other applications, you're
more than free to download the <a
href="http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4085451/iPhone_unofficial_SDK">iPhone
unofficial SDK</a>.  Last year when Bradley Kuhn, former FSF Executive
Director, spoke at <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/">Ohio
LinuxFest</a> he bragged about removing DRM from music, so I'd assume
they'd be find with this.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. iPhone endorses and supports Digital Restrictions Management
(DRM) technology.</b>
</p>
<p>
That's correct, the iPhone supports DRM'd files.  It also supports
non-DRM'd files too.  Unlike <a
href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/cmp/20080726/tc_cmp/209601121">Yahoo
which cut off customers who purchased this music</a>, Apple intends to
continue to support them.  Video files are still encumbered, but I
don't know of any legal way to get high quality digital video that
isn't encumbered.  That's an issue you'll have to take up with the
industry, Apple is just ensuring people can use it.  Remember, with
music DRM came first, then when it failed, we got open systems.  There
is no reason to expect it will be different with movies and TV shows.
</p>
<p>
Another aspect where the iPhone supports DRM is with iPhone apps.  I'd
imagine this is partially necessary to keep people from pirating the
apps.  When piracy rates for PC software <a
href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/53357">may run above
95%</a>, there no reason to assume that people aren't going to pirate
software.  Yes, there is DRM there, but it's pretty weak and lets me
load the apps on any of the phones on my plan.  Not to mention, it's
been shown to be trivial to remove the DRM, although, that currently
doesn't let one run the app on another phone.
</p>
<p><b>3. iPhone exposes your whereabouts and provides ways for others to track
   you without your knowledge.</b>
</p>
<p>
Complete bullshit.  Whoever wrote this has never touched an iPhone and
clearly doesn't realize that every app must ask before it can use your
location information.  The only tracking that happens is
whatever the carriers and law enforcement people typically use to
track folks.
</p>

<p><b>4. iPhone won’t play patent-and-DRM-free formats like Ogg Vorbis
and Theora.</b>
</p>
<p>
Waah.  Neither will most other things.  If Vorbis and Theora are great
from a technical perspective then you'd think you'd see a lot more of
them floating around -- but they're not.  Yes, I'm sure that Apple
could implement at Theora and Vorbis codec in the iPhone, but I doubt
it's worth their time.  The people who really care about those issues
aren't the kind of people who use iPhones to begin with.  Apple is
concerned about making the user experience good.  Providing too many
options leads to <my:command>M-x play-vorbis-song</my:command>.  Not
very friendly.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. iPhone is not the only option. There are better alternatives on the horizon
that respect your freedom, don’t spy on you, play free media formats,
and let you use free software – like the FreeRunner.</b></p>
<p>
That's somewhat correct.  The FreeRunner, along with with its
incomplete and buggy software is now available.  I've played with them
-- I tried to make a call with one.  It crashed.  I tried to lock at
pictures.  It crashed.  I couldn't check my email with it.  There
weren't any well polished apps for it.  The list goes on.  The
FreeRunner may be an option for some people, but it's expensive and
has little software.  If I'm trying to get stuff done, that's not a
good thing.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the five points, of which, I've just shown have approximately
2 points of validity, the campaign contains a <a
href="http://static.fsf.org/dbd/iphone-action-handout.pdf">questionnaire</a>
that you're supposed to use to quiz the Apple genius.  So, lets look
at these questions:
</p>
<p>
<b>1. Why do all developers have to submit their applications to Apple before
   they can be loaded onto an iPhone?
   Most smartphones, including those by OpenMoko, Nokia, RIM, Palm and
   even Microsoft, allow applications to come from a variety of sources, includ-
   ing free software developers. Free ”as in freedom” software development
   requires that users and developers be able to share and modify the source
   code for programs they use. iPhone users are not permitted by Apple to
   share or load modified versions of programs distributed through the App
   Store – even when a program’s developer wants users to be able to do
   this! Apple markets itself as empowering, alternative technology – How
   does Apple plan to support free software development?
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li>Did the Genius understand the issue of free software?</li>
      <li>Did they admit that other devices allow you to install
      applications from a variety of sources?</li>
    </ol>
</b></p>
<p>
I'd like to first point out that this is a couple of issues all
muddled together into one.  Apple does allow Free software developers
to develop for the iPhone, the WordPress people provide the source
code to their app.  Then, all that is standing in your way is the $99
developers fee.  Once you've got that, run Free and Open Source to
your hearts content.  The issue is regarding supporting Free
software.  Apple has no obligation or business case that would require
them to do so.  Their system is based on Open Source which is not free
-- if they chose to contribute back they may.  However, allowing just
anyone to create an untested unverified app that can brick your cell
phone or really whack out the cell network, well, that's not such a
great idea.  The FSF needs to realize that the cell network is
fundamentally different than a computer network.  A malicious or
poorly designed app can easily degrade the shared communication for
everyone and rack up lots of bills for you.  This poses a question
that I'd like to ask the FSF people: How would Free software benefit
the iPhone?
</p>
<p><b>
2. Why does iTunes still contain so much DRM-laden music?
   Services like Amazon, eMusic, Napster, Rhapsody, Play.com and 7digital
   are all selling music without DRM. A typical response to this might be
   that Apple has no option to sell media without DRM, but this is simply
   untrue. Jobs is the majority shareholder at Disney, and he could insist
   that its films be DRM-free. Apple should be leading the way to promote
   DRM-free music, but instead is lagging behind. What is Apple doing to fix
   this? If it really is the RIAA’s fault, can you tell me specifically what the
   RIAA said to Jobs when he asked for the ability to sell DRM-free
   music?
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>Did the Genius understand that Amazon, Rhapsody and Napster,
        along with many others are supporting DRM free music from the
        very same labels and artists that Apple is selling, laden with Digital
        Restrictions Management?</li>
    <li>Did the Genius understand that DRM is not about rights, but about
        restrictions? Restricting the people who buy the music and videos
        from playing them on a variety of devices, like CDs and DVDs.</li>
    <li>Did the Genius understand that Steve Jobs’ role at Disney could be
        used to leverage Disney going DRM-free?</li>
   </ol>
</b></p>
<p>
This one I don't have a solid answer for.  I'd imagine that part of
the reason why there are protected tracks has to do with longer term
contracts.  Another reason may have to deal with a lack of incentive
to change.  In either case, the Genius is unlikely to have this sort
of knowledge.  They're NOT your personal Apple PR person, so just deal
with it.</p>
<p>
Point two, I have a bit better response to.  I can understand why
individuals would want to protect their content with DRM - especially
when some people are so eager to steal your intellectual property.  So
in that response, it is about the rights of the producer.  When I
create something I should have the right to dictate to some degree who
it is used.  That's codified in US Copyright law -- you know, the
exclusive right bit.  Yeah, you might want to check that out.  What
isn't clearly codified is fair use.  It's a much murkier proposition.
Want to change this?  Start by codifying fair use in US law.
</p>
<p>
With regards to Disney, this is a pretty good point.  Steve could
probably push Disney to drop DRM, but there would need to be a
business case for it.  He has a fiduciary responsibility to
shareholders still -- so, unless you can show me that such a decision
would improve Disney's bottom line, then you have no argument.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. The iPhone 3G has GPS support. How can users be sure that the GPS
   cannot be used to track their position, without their permission?
   When the only thing preventing the GPS from being used is software, and
   the software in question is known only to Apple, why should users of the
   iPhone trust Apple?
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Did the Genius understand why GPS in a device is an issue?</li>
    <li>Did the Genius understand why the fact that the iPhone is proprietary
        is an issue here?</li>
    <li>Did the Genius express any kind of apology for this behavior?</li>
   </ol>
</b></p>
<p>
Once again, seem my previous point regarding their five claims against
the iPhone 3G.  This is not an issue.  The
software asks before it uses your location.  Every cell
phone has some sort of GPS in it that is used for E911 services,
therefore every cell phone could be rigged to spy on people.  You're
now crossing into conspiracy territory and losing credibility fast.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. In ’<a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/">Thoughts on Music</a>’, Steve Jobs said ”it is useful to remember that all
   iPods play music that is free of any DRM and encoded in ’open’ licensable
   formats such as MP3 and AAC”.
   If Steve really wants to see free and open formats, why doesn’t the iPhone
   play Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Theora video and FLAC? These formats require no
   licensing costs, and are not encumbered by patents. How does Apple plan
   to support these formats in future?
   <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Did the Genius understand the issue of free formats, such as Ogg
         Vorbis?
           <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>Did the Genius give any indication as to Apple’s lack of support
              for these formats?</li></ol></li></ol>
</b></p>
<p>
Let's turn this around, if the Free Software Foundation really
supports free and open formats, why don't they let my arbitrarily
designed custom bitstream for my handycam shot movie.  It's a
documented format that is free and open on the web.  Exactly.  Most
people don't care about these issues.  Using Apple stuff is like
shopping in the organic food aisle at the super market -- less
selection, but the stuff is tasty.  Windows, which supports all those
formats through various plugins, is like shopping in a regular
supermarket.  If the FSF had their way, we'd be shopping in
post-Katrina looted supermarkets with broken shopping carts --
multimedia doesn't work that well in Linux, maybe the desire to
support way too many formats is part of the reason.  Choice isn't
always good, especially when those choices really suck.  With regards
to FLAC, people who really care about FLAC already have padded rooms
with vacuum tube amps and wouldn't dream of listening to their music
on something as pedestrian as a personal music player.
</p>
<p><b>5. Last question. Why can the iPhone 3G only be activated by Apple and
   AT&amp;T?
   In the United States, the Register of Copyrights has ruled that consumers
   have the right to unlock their phones and switch to a different carrier. How
   does Apple plan to remedy this discrepancy?
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Did the Genius offer any advice or suggestions in unlocking your
        iPhone and moving it to another provider?</li>
        <li>Did the Genius admit that Apple is getting kickbacks from your phone
        bill in exchange for locking you to a single provider?</li>
        <li>Did the Genius offer any timeframe for Apple fixing this, despite the
        Register of Copyrights ruling?</li>
    </ol>
</b></p>
<p>
The decision the FSF is referring to is the latest set of <a
href="http://www.copyright.gov/1201/index.html">DMCA exemptions</a>.
You'll notice that they don't require carriers to assist you in
unlocking your phone.  The decision merely makes it legal to unlock
your phone.  So, FSF people, get cracking and write the software that
will allow me to slip in a local SIM card when I go to Greece.
</p>
<p>
With regards to the other sub points, there is no reason why the Apple rep
should provide the information on how to change a carrier.  They've
got a contract with AT&amp;T saying that AT&amp;T will be the exclusive
carrier.  AT&amp;T is subsidizing the prices of the phones, contributing
to advertising, maintaining the infrastructure that makes the phone
useful.  This isn't cheap, in fact AT&amp;T has said that they're planning
on taking a <a
href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/cmp/20080724/tc_cmp/209401147">$720
million dollar hit</a> from subsidizing the iPhone.  That's a huge
chunk of change that AT&amp;T is spending to support a piece of Apple
hardware.  Also, in the US switching to another provider inherently
makes your iPhone suck more as T-Mobile is the only other major GSM
carrier in the US and their 3G network <a
href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/30/t-mobile-3g-service-coming-october-1-to-27-markets/">won't
be ready until October 1st</a>, and even then, it's only 27 markets.
</p>
<p>
With regards to kickbacks, it's well documented that Apple is getting
even more kickbacks from AT&amp;T.  Just by purchasing a phone at an Apple
store you're causing <a
href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/06/19/apple-oppenheimer-says-att-iphone-subsidy-is-325/">AT&amp;T
to pay $100 to Apple</a> for signing up a new customer, on top of the
$300 or so that they're subsidizing the purchase price.  However, the
older kickback system where Apple got a portion of the monthly bill,
is <a href="http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/06/09/3g-iphone-drops-revenue-sharing-t-apple-due-handset-subsidy">no longer in effect</a>.
</p>
<p>
So, I think that I've been able to go through and show that most of
the campaign by the FSF is wrong, or just based on incorrect facts,
and on the basis of these incorrect facts they're going into Apple
stores and bothering employees who 1) really don't care and 2) have
better things to do.  Yeah, way to go FSF, I'm sure you'll find some
<a href="http://linuxhaters.blogspot.com/">freetards</a> who will be excited by this, but everyone else sees that
you're just being dicks.  Go back to your crappy little script that
downloads text only web pages and the rest of will enjoy the future.
Oh wait, nevermind, <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/rms/can-we-rescue-olpc-from-windows">Stallman deleted the wireless firmware from his laptop</a>...
