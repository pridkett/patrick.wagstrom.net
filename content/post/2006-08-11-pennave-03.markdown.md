I released [PennAve](http://pennave.sf.net/) 0.3 today.  This new release brings a slew of nifty new features that you can find on my [gallery](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/). Among them are:

  * Slide show
  * Nifty new graphics
  * RSS feeds
  * Customizable landing page
  * Improved performance thanks to caching

Anyway, if you're running [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/), go grab [F-Spot](http://www.f-spot.org/) and start sorting your photos.  Then put them online with [PennAve](http://pennave.sf.net/)!
