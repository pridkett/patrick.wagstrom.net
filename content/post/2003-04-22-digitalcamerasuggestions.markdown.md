title: Digital Camera Suggestions

I've been considering getting a digital camera.  I almost bought the [Kodak LS443](http://www.kodak.com/global/en/digital/easyShare/ls443/ls443.jhtml) and even went out to Best Buy to look at it.  In the end, I think that God was saying no because my order didn't go through at Buy.com.  Ho hum.  So if you have suggestions of a good 4.0MP or greater digital camera, can you post them?  I really don't want to spend more the $400 for the setup.  The total for the 443 and a 256MB SD card was going to be right around $400.
