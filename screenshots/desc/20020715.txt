Just a simple shot showing my desktop using both monitors.  I've elected not to use xinerama because I loose acceleration and DGA under xinerama.  Using two displays, I can't drag windows back and forth, but I still have accelleration.  It also prooves to be much more stable.  You can see that I'm running KDE now.  Mainly because its support for dual head is so much superior to Gnome.  Taken under RedHat 7.3.
