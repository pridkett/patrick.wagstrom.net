    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>That's right, I literally found a Mac Classic last night when I was walking
home from the <a href="http://dean2004.meetup.com/">Dean Meetup</a>.  It was
sitting by a trash can so I picked it up and took it home.  It was cold walk
home with it, about a mile or so was left in my walk and it was about 15 degrees
outside.  Luckily it was pretty light and I could carry it with one hand.</p>

<p>When I got it home, I first decided to see if it would power up.  Taking a power
cable and plugging it in I was greeted with the familiar Macintosh chime but
not screen came up.  After about 30 seconds it started to smell a lot like a
model train set, I knew this couldn't be good so I turned it off.</p>

<p>I began to think about what I could do, and only one thing came to mind,
<a href="http://www.applefritter.com/hacks/macquarium/">make a MacQuarium</a>.
So that's what I've begun to do.  Unfortunately, I don't have a nifty digital
camera, so there won't be a lot of pictures, but I'll probably do a few as
I progress.  More updates to come.</p>
