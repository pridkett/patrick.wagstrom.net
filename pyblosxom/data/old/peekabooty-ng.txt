Peekabooty-NG

Well, for those of you not in the know, I've been working on an updated version of <a href="http://www.peek-a-booty.org/">Peekabooty</a>.  This one is written entirely in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> because it makes development a lot easier.  Right now it's not fully working yet, but a lot of the components have been laid down to make it a much better architecture. Most importantly, the new system is fully multithreaded.  This makes it a whole lot nicer than the old verison.  Still some bells and whistles that need to be cleaned up, but other than that, it's all good.
