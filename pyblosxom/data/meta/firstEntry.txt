First pyblosxom Entry

<!-- Date: 2003-10-26 00:05 -->
<p>
This is the first entry that I'm doing with the new blogging system,
pyblosxom.  I've looked at a lot of systems, and for the past year I used <a
href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> but it was probably a bit
more than I actually needed.  To make things worse it is written in Perl and I
HATE perl with a passion.
</p>
<p>
So when the time came to install a new server setup, I decided that <a
href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom">pyblosxom</a> would make a
nice choice.  It's simple, extensible, and it's written in <a
href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm still ironing some various things with this.  Among them are the
mod_rewrite voodoo that I'm using to automagically redirect stuff around
without allowing my web directory to become too horribly messy again.  I'd
rather have my config file be messy than my web directory.
