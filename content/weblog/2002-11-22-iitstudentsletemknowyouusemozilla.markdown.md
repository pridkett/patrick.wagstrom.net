The [IIT Course Evaluation Site](http://iit.ecollege.com/) does not currently
support Mozilla.  Let them know that you use Mozilla and would like it to be
supported.  Email [evaluation@iit.edu](mailto:evaluation@iit.edu) and
[techsupport@realed.com](techsupport@realed.com) and ask them to support
Mozilla based browsers.  Here is the email that I just sent.

    As a person who cares both about my personal security and the quality of
    my software, I am more than a little surprised at your lack of support
    for Mozilla based browsers on the IIT evaluation site.  Despite the fact
    that it has been shown that Mozilla (the engine on which newer netscape
    browsers are based) is the most robust and standards compliant web
    browser available.  Even looking at the chart I am referred to at:

    http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/reference/browser_chart/

    it inidicates that Mozilla 1.0 and 1.1 support all of the features that
    would be required of an HTML page.  This leaves people who use Unix
    based systems in a quandry.  Either downgrade their software, or use a
    buggy commercial browser (see http://www.iit.edu/~wagspat/exploittest.html)
    that has the possibility to execute code without my asking.

    I would like to know the reason for the lack of support for Mozilla
    based browsers.

    Thank You,

    Patrick Wagstrom
