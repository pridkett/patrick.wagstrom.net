Open Source Screencasting part 2
<!-- Date: 2007-12-10 00:21 -->

<p>
This is a followup to my original article on <a
href="/weblog/linux/open-source-screencasting.xml">Open Source
Screencasting with VNC in GNOME</a> from a few days ago.  Since then,
I've been on a bit of an adventure learning about Flex, ActionScript,
and finding out ways that I can manage to hack on this nifty little
program with minimal pain.
</p>
<p>
The most important thing, is that I've found the <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/downloads/">free Flex2
SDK</a>.  The compiler and tools appear to be written in Java, so
they'll work just fine under Linux.  Of course, there are those that
will be quick to note that these tools are only free as in beer, and
not Free as in speech.  This means that if you're not a student and
you can't get your hands on FlexBuilder for free, you can still hack
on the code.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to these tools, I've been able to start modifying the original
code to <a href="http://www.osflash.org/fvnc/">FVNC</a> to suit my
needs as screencasting application.  Thus far, I've added a set of
extra parameters that can be passed in the flashVars attribute of the
embed tag.
</p>
<ul>
<li> server - a servername to populate connection list with</li>
<li> port - port number to connect to</li>
<li> connect - set to "true" if you'd like to autoconnect based on values from server and port variables.</li>
<li> hide - set to "true" if you'd like the connection dialog to automatically disappear when connect is called.</li>
<li> fit - set to "true" if fitToScreen should be automatically checked</li>
<li> title - set to a value for a new title in the app</li>
<li> disableServer - set to "true" to disable changing server</li>
<li> disablePort - set to "true" to disable changing port</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thus, through some interesting use of the <b>server</b>, <b>port</b>,
<b>connect</b>, and <b>hide</b> flashVars, I can make it so opening
the page automatically connects to the VNC instance and allows the
user to start viewing the presentation right away (or be prompted for
a password first).  This really has taken the resources necessary for
a remote presentation down quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
For my talks, I'll probably combine this with the free conference
service from <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</a>, that
allows folks to dial in with regular phones and then listen to the
talk and slides at the same time.  It's a pretty slick solution.  If
only there was a nice way to include a component in the modified FVNC
that also channeled my voice and some video, then it would be really
great.  I'd imagine there is a way to do that using some of the nifty
stuff in Flex2, but I'm by no means an expert in the technology.
</p>
<p>
In the mean time, if folks would like my modifications, including a
precompiled binary of the modified FVNC.swf program, you can get it by
using git and cloning <a
