bibTeXML

<p>
As if I really needed another project that I will only half finish, today
I started to muck around with bibTeXML because I wanted something more powerful
than the standard bibTeX setup.  Well, I've done some nifty hacking with
my mad XSLT skills and got it so it can do cross references on names of 
authors for when authors show up multiple times.  Right now it just renders
to an HTML document, .bib format is next.
