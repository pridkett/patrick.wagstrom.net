Recently I've been trying to keep my blog out of the political realm.
I'm perfectly aware that there are much better pundits and analysts with much better
connections that a lowly Ph.D. candidate.  Also, I sort of agree with
[Jon Stewart](http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2652831), partisan bickering
is just bad for America.

Occassionally though, a gem comes across that is too good to miss.  Might I introduce
you to [Operation Clean Sweep](http://www.pacleansweep.com/).  It has but
a single goal, defeat EVERY elected legislator in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
It doesn't matter if they're democrat, republican, or some other third party.  The
premise is that those who govern Pennsylvania are out of touch and need to go.  Given
[Senator Jay Costa](http://www.senatorcosta.com/)'s complete ineptitude
at even providing information about where he stands on issues, much less responding to
my letters, I would tend to agree.
