I've gotten ill and passed out on more than one occassion in my past.  At one
point, it was so bad that I needed to seek lots of medical help and wear
a heart monitor in hopes of tracking down what it was.  I think I almost
passed out last Friday when I was sick, I didn't, but it felt like I could.
Today, I read that a Pennsylvania law [requires
physicians to notify PennDOT about such issues](http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/opinion/columnists/vassilaros/s_205766.html).






This is total big brother.  Yes they ask when you get your license if
you have neurological conditions and such.  Yes I answered truthfully
that I don't.  Under this law, if I pass out, they have to report it and
I have to go to court to get my license back.  But it gets worse.  A man
in Mt. Lebannon admitted that he drank between 6-10 beers each day of the
weekend to his driver, but never mixed with driving.  His last offense
was 23 years ago.  Yet the doctor violated the hippocratic oath and
report him anyway.






I hate Pennsylvania.
