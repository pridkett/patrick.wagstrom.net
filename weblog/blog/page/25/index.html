  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, the van is dead.  It proved to be a good vehicle and had a good life.
In the end it just couldn&#8217;t keep up, and in the words of my Dad, I was supposed
to &#8220;shoot it and put it out of it&#8217;s misery&#8221;.  With $500 of engine repair and
$1300 or tranny repair and more costs to get it licensed in Pennsylvania,
I had to give up.  It had a lived a nice good life.</p>

<p>I decided to take a few pictures of the vehicle to give me something to
remember it by.  In the end, it was good vehicle, lasted me for a little over
four years, during which time I put about 60,000 miles on it.  It was able
to get me here to Pittsburgh, and was able to get Kristina and I to and from
Texas for the wedding and all.  Here are some pictures of it as it was being
taken away.</p>

<p>In related news, we&#8217;re going to go looking for a new car next weekend.  No word
on whether or not we&#8217;re going to buy one or not.  If anyone knows of any good
dealers in Pittsburgh (or has references about the dealers on Liberty ave),
let us know.  Unfortunately, we&#8217;re basically confined to the Liberty avenue
dealers as they&#8217;re the only ones withing walking distance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the more interesting things about living in Pittsburgh is that we&#8217;re
a lot closer to the coast and mountains (or hills, or bumps, whatever you call
the Appalachians) and as such we get weather from the coasts.  Last year I had
to try an fly out while the remnants of Hurrican Isabel were bearing down on
Pittsburgh.  This year, we get the remnants of Hurricane Frances.  It appears
that it&#8217;s coming right for us.  <a href="http://www.weather.com/">Weather.com</a>
says that we have a 100% chance of rain coming up here.  What fun.</p>

<p>I also found out something interesting.  I was wondering why my thumbnails from
<a href="/weblog/weblog/photo/saturnStitch.xml">yesterday&#8217;s stitching entry</a> were
so large.  Apparently I forgot to tell <a href="http://imagemagick.sourceforge.net/">ImageMagick</a> to strip out the profile information.  I should have
used the following command line: convert -size 200x200 infile.jpg -resize 200x200 +profile APP1 outfile.jpg.  This removes the extra
<a href="http://www.exif.org/">EXIF</a> information embedded in the file, which isn&#8217;t needed for web thumbnails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Like most people, I find how both parties are using September 11th as
a political device morally apalling.  I also find the purple heart stickers
that republican delegates are wearing a disgrace and shameful.  But back to
the main topic.  The New York Times  has an
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/01/politics/campaign/01about.html">interesting article</a> about the lives of a lot of the former workers at Windows
on the World, the restaurant on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center.
It&#8217;s an interesting contrast between them and what the delegates are saying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hot on the heels of me <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/academic/ossimLog4Net.xml">starting to
use</a> <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">Log4Net</a> in OSSim, comes my first code addition
to the project.  The original ColoredConsoleAppender only works on Windows because it calls Win32 APIs.
I don&#8217;t really like that fact because I use <a href="http://mono-project.com/">Mono</a> under
<a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Linux</a>.  However, I remember from my good old <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/">BBS days</a> that you could use ANSI escape codes to do fun colors.  These also
work under Linux as that&#8217;s what you use to colorize your prompts (something I&#8217;m a fan of as it allows
me to easily see what system I&#8217;m on).</p>

<p>With a little bit of hacking out comes <a href="/weblog/projects/personal/log4net/AnsiColoredConsoleAppender.cs">AnsiColoredConsoleAppender</a>.  This little puppy works just like the regular ColoredConsoleAppender
except that it works under Linux and MacOSX.  Oh yeah, and you&#8217;ve got a new tag,
attrs instead of adding on HighIntensity to the
foreColor tag.  In addition, you have lots more values for the
attrs tag such as
Bright,
Dim,
Underscore,
Blink,
Reverse,
Hidden, or
Strikethrough.  Try it out and send me feedback.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided that finally need a nice logging framework in place for OSSim.
Without it, it&#8217;s going to be hard to track down what is going on in the
application.  Being as it&#8217;s written in <a href="http://mono-project.com/">C#</a>
I&#8217;ve decided to use <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/">log4net</a>.
Which seems all nice, but there is one major problem, I can&#8217;t actually build
the software.</p>

<p>You see, in order to build log4net, one needs to use <a href="http://nant.sourceforge.net/">NAnt</a>, which is basically <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>
for .Net platforms.  Personally, I don&#8217;t care much for Ant because it&#8217;s not
as straight forward as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>
is.  Also, I don&#8217;t think it works with my new <a href="/weblog/weblog/academic/ossimAutoconf.xml">AutoConf</a> goodness.  Anyway, the other big problem with NAnt is
that the current stable version doesn&#8217;t compile under Mono.  Apparently it&#8217;s
some sort of regression bug that keeps it from happening.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a guy to do?  Well, the last stable release was last December, so
I went to download a nightly build. After <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;aid=1017700&amp;group_id=31650&amp;atid=402868">some frobnicating</a>
I was able to get it to work and compile.  This was a relief.  So I now have
a working install of NAnt on my system.  But then a new problem showed up.</p>

<p>Apparently massive portions of the NAnt vocabulary have been changed, meaning
that the program doesn&#8217;t recognize the build files for Log4Net.  This was
annoying to say the least.  Thankfully, they include a binary of Log4Net for
Mono along with the distribution of Log4Net.  So I can use that, but I&#8217;m still
not happy becuase I can&#8217;t build my own and I can&#8217;t hack on it.  Because I
would really like to implement the ColoredConsoleAppender.  Sigh.</p>

<p>Anyway, logging now works, it&#8217;s in <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a>, which I migrated the repository to yesterday.  Still not entirely
comfortable with subversion yet, but
<a href="http://kenneths.org/flog/">elte</a> was gonna hook me up with a book
on it.  Afterall, I can use it for research.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason I got an uncontrollable urge to force OSSim to use autoconf,
automake, and assorted friends.  It&#8217;s kinda nice knowing that I know have
a real set of make files for the project.  Unfortunately, it still is written
in <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">C#</a> which means I&#8217;m limited to the
ever increasing set of platforms that have a C# implementation.</p>

<p>Anyway, it proved to be more of a challenge than I thought.  However,
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> has the entire
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/autobook/autobook_toc.html">autobook</a>
online.  This is really helpful and probably the best resource I&#8217;ve found
for the confusion that is Autoconf and Automake.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So rather than doing work today, I decided to write a nice little tutorial on
how to use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygtkmoz">PyGTKMoz</a>.
It is basically a mirror of Erik Dasque&#8217;s <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html">similar C# tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>But that was only half the fun.  In true overkill style I felt that I had to
create my own XML dialect for this little project to automatically number
figures, create hyperlinks, and do all sorts of other fun stuff.  So, as
a result, there is an xml and html version.</p>

<p>Without further delay I present: <a href="/weblog/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.html">Creating a GNOME Web Browser with Python</a> or the <a href="/weblog/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.xml">XML version if you like</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog">Kenneth</a> decided to try
and coin a new term, &#8220;Luddition Through Economics&#8221;.  Such a term basically
means that someone is a luddite because they don&#8217;t have the money to not
be one.  I guess that describes me fairly well.  Well, actually, it was
coined to describe me.</p>

<p>Anyway, the discussion progressed to see if he could become the top hit
for such a phrase.  It shouldn&#8217;t have been hard because &#8220;Luddition&#8221; isn&#8217;t
really a word.  Well it is, we defined it as &#8220;the process of becoming a
luddite&#8221;, but whatever.  Anyway, so he&#8217;s now <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=luddition+through+economics">top hit on google for it</a>.</p>

<p>So then the question is this, why am I writing about &#8220;Luddition through
economics&#8221;.  The answer is simple, I&#8217;m trying to see what it takes to knock
him out of first place.  This is a little Google experiment if you will.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the Ninth Circuit court of appeals, which serves the western 1/5th of
America, begins work on <a href="http://gilmorevsashcroft.com/">Gilmore vs
Ashcroft</a>.  A brief summary is in order.</p>

<p>John Gilmore made millions as one of the original programmers at SUN.  He
has since retired and become a full time philanthropist.  He&#8217;s also one of
the founder of the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>.   On July 4th,
2002 he dared to challenge the ticket agent and refused to produce ID for
a flight he was scheduled to take.  He was told that the law required
him to produce his ID.  Furthermore, he was told that the law was secret
and he would not be allowed to read it.</p>

<p>This is a huge case for Americans as, if we win, it will establish that America
is not a police state and we&#8217;re not obligated to produce a papers on command
from anyone that asks for them.  Please, get the word out on this case.  It&#8217;s
a little difficult to influence the courts, but it&#8217;s important to know what
they&#8217;re up to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve gotten ill and passed out on more than one occassion in my past.  At one
point, it was so bad that I needed to seek lots of medical help and wear
a heart monitor in hopes of tracking down what it was.  I think I almost
passed out last Friday when I was sick, I didn&#8217;t, but it felt like I could.
Today, I read that a Pennsylvania law <a href="http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/opinion/columnists/vassilaros/s_205766.html">requires
physicians to notify PennDOT about such issues</a>.</p>

<p>This is total big brother.  Yes they ask when you get your license if
you have neurological conditions and such.  Yes I answered truthfully
that I don&#8217;t.  Under this law, if I pass out, they have to report it and
I have to go to court to get my license back.  But it gets worse.  A man
in Mt. Lebannon admitted that he drank between 6-10 beers each day of the
weekend to his driver, but never mixed with driving.  His last offense
was 23 years ago.  Yet the doctor violated the hippocratic oath and
report him anyway.</p>

<p>I hate Pennsylvania.</p>
