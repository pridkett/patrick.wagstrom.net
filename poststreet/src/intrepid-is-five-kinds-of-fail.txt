Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex is Five Kinds of Fail
<!-- Date: 2008-11-16 08:31 -->

<p>
I've been a Ubuntu user since before it was called Ubuntu, back in the days
when the domain name was no-name-yet.com.  It wasn't a hard switch from Fedora
Core, which at the time was Core 1 or Core 2.  Ubuntu was like entering a
magical world where stuff just worked.  At the time I had an IBM ThinkPad
A31 -- it worked perfectly, wifi and all.  Now, things weren't quite as
good as they are now, the magic of <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a>
had not yet arrived, and <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/">DBUS</a> was
just a thought in <a href="http://www.j5live.com/">j5's mind</a>.
</p>
<p>
The various revisions of Ubuntu made it better and better.  Improvements to
<a href="/weblog/linux/gnome-monitor-resolution.xml">multi-monitor support</a>
were wonderful -- suddenly presentations were easy.  With Ubuntu Hardy basically
everything on my laptop worked.  Wifi, suspend, sound, bluetooth.  It was really
nice.  Unfortunately, it appears that Intrepid is a step backward -- numerous
features that were supported in Hardy no longer function properly.  So, here I
present my Intrepid Ibex Five Kinds of Fail.

<ol>
	<li>NetworkManager periodically disables networking (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/network-manager/+bug/291062">291062</a>)</li>
	<li>Atheros drivers are no longer properly supported (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/linux/+bug/259157">259157</a>)</li>
	<li>PulseAudio sometimes hangs after suspend/resume (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/292129">292129</a>)</li>
	<li>My thinkpad occasionally fails to suspend (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/298683">298683</a>)</li>
	<li>NetworkManager forgets my WPA saved key (<a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/276578">276578</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not intending this to be another "Linux Sux0rs" post or anything like that, but here are
five major issues that worked just fine in the last version of Ubuntu and now are total
fail making the Ubuntu experience of today remind me of the Ubuntu experience from Dapper
days.  There is certainly some irony that several of the features relate to wifi which
Ubuntu brags about having great support for in Intrepid.  Maybe I should have heeded
<a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2005/10.html">jwz's advice when he lamented
about upgrading three years ago</a>.  Sigh...Here's hoping Jaunty won't have the same problems.
