Tentative Honeymoon Plans

<p>
We're looking at some places for honeymoons right now.  Kristina's parents are
giving us some points to use for time shares.  We were thinking about going to
the Bahamas, but by the time that we factored in the cost of airline tickets
and a rental car (being as I'm a youngun and cars will cost us to rent).  So
what we're looking at doing is spending a week in Galveston or somewhere else
along the Texas coast and then boarding a cruise for a week that leaves from
Texas.  This greatly simplifies stuff and will probably be about the same cost.
