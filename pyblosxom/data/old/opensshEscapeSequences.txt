OpenSSH Escape Sequences

With telnet most people know you can hit ^] to escape back to the program, but most people don't realize that you can do a similar thing with OpenSSH.  This is VERY helpful when your session dies.  In OpenSSH the escape key is the tilde.  Here is the segment from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh">OpenSSH manual</a>.

<b>Escape Characters</b>

     When a pseudo terminal has been requested, ssh supports a number of func-
     tions through the use of an escape character.

     A single tilde character can be sent as ~~ or by following the tilde by a
     character other than those described below.  The escape character must
     always follow a newline to be interpreted as special.  The escape charac-
     ter can be changed in configuration files using the EscapeChar configura-
     tion directive or on the command line by the -e option.

     The supported escapes (assuming the default `~') are:

     <b>~.</b>      Disconnect

     <b>~^Z</b>     Background ssh

     <b>~#</b>      List forwarded connections

     <b>~&amp;</b>      Background ssh at logout when waiting for forwarded connection /
             X11 sessions to terminate

     <b>~?</b>      Display a list of escape characters

     <b>~C</b>      Open command line (only useful for adding port forwardings using
             the -L and -R options)

    <b> ~R</b>      Request rekeying of the connection (only useful for SSH protocol
             version 2 and if the peer supports it)
