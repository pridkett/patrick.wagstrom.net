MythTV Talk @ WPLUG - Saturday June 4th, 10am - 2pm

<!-- Date: 2005-05-31 13:51 -->
<p>
This is just a little post to pimp my own talk at
<a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> this weekend.  On Saturday I'll be
giving a talk about <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> and the
alphabet soup of standards and regulations that accompany it, including
NSTC, ATSC, MPEG, and more!  I'll also talk a little bit about the broadcast
flag and why we still need to be on the look out for future similar legislation.
</p>
<p>
For those that are interested in seeing a live system, I'll have it running on
both my laptop and my desktop while there.  We won't be able to play with live
TV but you should get a feel for the other features of the system.  If you've
got particular issues you'd like me to talk about, shoot me an email and I'll
try to work them in.
