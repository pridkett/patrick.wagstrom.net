Calling Artists: PennAve Logo Request

<!-- Date: 2007-02-04 23:42 -->
<p>
As part of the preparation for PennAve 0.4, I'd like to give the application
a little bit of branding magic.  So, if anyone out there has some graphics
talent and would like to give me a hand, I could use a logo for PennAve.  My
original thought was to take a photo of the street sign at the corner of
Penn Ave and Main St here in Pittsburgh and then trace that to make a vector
graphic for the logo.  But obviously, if you're an artist and have a better
idea, I certainly am open to it.  So, artists of the world, immortalize
yourself in free software.  Submit a logo today!
