  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a> and I purchase a fair amount of
DVDs in the second market (used).  Usually we get pretty good deals on them, for
example, last weekend we bought 8 DVDs from Hollywood video for about $50.  One
consequence of our DVD buying habit is that our friends like to borrow DVDs from us.
Then I usually forget who we&#8217;ve loaned the DVDs to, and next thing you know they
go missing like my copy of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120660/">Enemy of the State</a>.</p>

<p>If we had a Mac, there&#8217;s a killer program called <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> that does an amazing job of cataloging materials.  I sought out a similar
thing for Linux, and found a few nascent projects &#8211; all of which had bugs.  The one
that seemed the best designed, and fit most with my current computing experience was
<a href="http://www.mcatalog.net/">MCatalog</a>.  However, it appears that its web
hosting isn&#8217;t overly stable because the web page is frequently down, and that it&#8217;s been
more or less abandoned for the last nine months.  Thankfully the code was in the
<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/">GNOME CVS archive</a>, so I pulled down the latest version
and started hacking on it.</p>

<p>Like any good OSS programmer, I&#8217;ve tried to contact the original author to see if he is
accepting patches (bug reports are handled through <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME&#8217;s bugzilla</a>) &#8211; but I have yet to get a response.  It&#8217;s getting to the point where I need
revision history on my files in case I do something stupid, and also where I think that
other people may find my improvments useful.  So, I&#8217;ve put a subversion repository that
everyone can check out the newest code from.  Just check stuff out from
<a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/mcatalog">https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/mcatalog</a>
and start playing around with it.  So far I&#8217;ve updated it to stop throwing deprecation errors,
fixed a bug with it deleting covers for everything, and made it show icons if the media is
actually checked out at that time.  More fun will ensue I&#8217;m sure.</p>

<p>In the mean time, if you use it and have feature requests of bug reports, shoot me an email.
I&#8217;ll handle my stuff informally until I get more feedback from the original author.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pittsburgh has seen some absolutely amazing weather this weekend, which
all things considered, is quite rare.  On Saturday,
<a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a> and I, along with a
couple of friends decided to ride the inclines on Mount Washington.  The
Monongahela and Duquesne inclines both provide excellent views of the
city and if you&#8217;re a student at <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">Pitt</a>
or <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a> you get to ride for free.  At
the top of the Duquesne incline I took a couple of pictures and then
pieced together a panorama of the city.  I&#8217;m fairly pleased with the results,
the coloration on the camera is a little off, but not bad for our little
point and click camera.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I managed to unpack the T2000 server.   It&#8217;s a pretty large box, but not overly huge.  The hard disks are nice little 73GB SAS drives that pull right out of the box.  The CD/DVD drive is a sleek slot loading drive. I do have to say, <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> did a good job making this box look really nice and sleek.  A datacenter of these things would be quite cool (literally and figuratively).</p>

<p>My initial hope was to commandeer a monitor, plug in a USB keyboard, and go at it.  One major proble, there is no video card installed on the box, although if I had an extra PCI-E card, it would be interesting to see what happens with one.  Initial system boot-up and installation is done via the serial console. Okay, find a null modem and a laptop with a serial port (my new T43p does not have a serial port).  Wrong.  Even if I could have found a null modem, the regular serial port is not the serial console, instead you need to use an RJ45->DB9 dongle to get a serial terminal.  Of course, these things were no where to be found around <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily, an email went off, and a schmeatic of the circuit came back.  Thinking for a bit, I remembered that <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make Magazine vol 1</a> had an article on how to build a <a href="http://www.ossmann.com/5-in-1.html">5-in-1 network cable</a>.  Off to Radio Shack for some parts.  Unfortunately, Radio Shack has slowly turned itself into &#8220;crappy overpriced cell-phone shack&#8221;.  Not a single RJ45-DB9 connector was to be found.  The only DB9 connectors I could find were just a single snap in port.  In fact, they didn&#8217;t even have a coupler for RJ45.  So I picked up two of them.  The next step was to mangle an ethernet cable, and have some breadboard fun.  After about 30 minutes, I had my circuit.</p>

        <figcaption>The Ghetto RJ45->DB9 Converter </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Luckily, after a little bit of tweaking the circuit, and reseating some wires on my breadboard, the ALOM on the T2000 started up and spit out data to the Hyper Terminal running on <a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina&#8217;s</a> laptop.  It was pretty straight forward to get the network console running after this point, and yes, it can DHCP an address, but be very careful about putting the network admin port on a public network because the VxWorks OS that runs ALOM does NOT support SSH.  Suckage.  Here&#8217;s another shot of getting everything going.  I&#8217;ve got the serial terminal up on the HP laptop and the network terminal up on the T43p.  After booting into Solaris, it&#8217;s much better to use SSH to connect to the OS than go over the network terminal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a long series of delays and communication problems, the <a href="http://www.sun.com/servers/coolthreads/t2000/test/over.jsp">T2000 server</a> from
<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a> has finally arrived.  Apparently there was an issue with my original submission back in February.  Once I
resubmitted my request I was approved in fairly short order and received some pretty good responses from folks at Sun.  Kudos to them for making the
most out of an annoying situation.</p>

<p>I do have a few critiques about the process.  First of all, the sales people were, for lack of a better term, sales people.  I started to get
random messages from people I had no knowledge of and seemed to have no relation to me.  I was sent an invoice with a subject line of &#8220;INVOICE&#8221;,
which of course usually goes right to the spam filter.  Finally, I got some helpful documents under a subject line of &#8220;[Fwd: [Fwd: cool tool FYI]]&#8221;,
with no explanation of why I was getting it.  So let me provide a few suggestions to make the process nicer to people like me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use informative subject lines that are not all capitalized.  Remove all those &#8220;Fwd&#8221; headers too.  Instead write &#8220;Helpful Sun T2000 Documents&#8221;.</li>
<li><p>If you&#8217;re going to send me an email from an address that looks
real, make sure you reply to it when I ask a question about it.
This goes for you, Rebecca Lukens.  I received an Invoice which
said I needed to take some action regarding it, I replied to it
with a few questions and never got a response.  I tried again, and never got a response.  There was also no contact information in the message, which I&#8217;ve reproduced in verbatim here:</p>

<p><code>Try &amp; Buy quote attached.  Thanks!</code></p></li>
<li><p>Take some time to say why you&#8217;re emailing me.  For example Instead of the above message, I would have appreciated something like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Wagstrom,</p>

<p>Attached you&#8217;ll find a quote for your recent Sun Microsystems T2000 Try and Buy request.
Should you choose to keep the machine beyond 60 days, you&#8217;ll be required to pay the full
amount of the invoice unless other arrangements have been made.  For right now, please
enjoy the machine and we hope it suits your needs well.</p>

<p>If you have questions, you can contact me at:
[CONTACT INFORMATION HERE]</p></blockquote>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice it&#8217;s a form letter.  They don&#8217;t even have to think more than pasting in the current text, but it would be very helpful to me. Also, the change would give it a chance of evading the <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a> spam filters.</p></li>
<li><p>When sending out unsolicited attachments via email, also include a web link to a site on sun.com where I can retrieve these documents.
I trust documents coming from sun.com more than I do general email that is sent to me from unknown individuals.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>But like I said, the process was actually relatively painless.   A few frustrations, but I&#8217;m happy with the opportunity to test out this technology.
We&#8217;ll start benchmarking it soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I admit, I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a> news junky.  In the
past I used a combination of Firefox, AdBlock, and Privoxy to keep their
annoyances to a minimum.  Then yesterday they dropped the bomb.  Ack, their
new site is just annoying.  I don&#8217;t care about the videos or gratuitous crap
they put about podcasts and what not.  I visit it in my browser for the news.
So what&#8217;s a guy to do?</p>

<p>Well, when you&#8217;re bored in class, one easy thing to do is to write a
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> user script.  Simply
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/projects/personal/firefox/greasemonkey/cnnMod.user.js">download cnnMod.user.js</a> once you&#8217;ve installed greasemonkey and watch all sorts of
annoying elements be zapped.  Have fun kids.  If you&#8217;ve got suggestions,
let me know and I&#8217;ll add them in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 06.06 (note the delay from the original 06.04), aka Dapper Drake,
is well into development, and being as I have a shiny new laptop, I decided to give it a shot.  So,
here&#8217;s a list of five things that I like about Dapper and five things that could use some work.  Many of
these aren&#8217;t necessary Dapper specific, but they&#8217;re things that I didn&#8217;t do with Breezy (or Hoary, or Warty&#8230;).</p>

<p><strong>Five Things That Rock</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/">deskbar applet</a> - totally changes the way you use your computer.  Alt-F3 is your friend.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a></li>
<li>Improved startup time</li>
<li><a href="http://www.banshee-project.org/Main_Page">Banshee</a> and iPod transcoding</li>
<li>SSHFS doesn&#8217;t crash in Nautilus</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Five things that need help</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>gtkmozembed needs some serious help - breaks <a href="http://developer.imendio.com/wiki/Blam">Blam!</a> and <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a></li>
<li>Sleep/Hibernate not so hot on my T43p</li>
<li>xgl halts my T43p</li>
<li>No built in support for fingerprint scanner (but it does work)</li>
<li>NetworkManager tends to halt sometimes - especially if I unplug the network cable</li>
</ol>


<p>Overall I&#8217;m really impressed.  I&#8217;m hoping that by the May <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> installfest
I can have <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xgl">xgl</a> working and all bugs hammered out.  Of
course, my dream for a Ubuntu focused installfest is dead because
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/175272/">Dapper is delayed</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last most graduate students I&#8217;m enjoying my spring break doing work.  But hey, at least I don&#8217;t have many meetings this week.  Most of my work has been on trying to get a paper out the door and finished up for a <a href="http://www.cscw2006.org/">CSCW 2006</a> this fall. It&#8217;s a little weird trying to explain to my non-CS type friends that most CS conferences you submit a full paper, and it&#8217;s a lot like a journal publication process.</p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s not always easy, I find that I&#8217;m pretty easily distracted, especially now that I just got this shiny new <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T43p">T43p laptop</a> from <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html">my advisor</a>.  Desperately seeking a way to make myself a little more productive, or maybe just kill a bit of time, I swung over to everyone&#8217;s favorite productivity/<a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/gtd">GTD</a> site, <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43folders</a>.   It was there that I read about <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/15/fake-fullscreen/">full screen mode</a>, and how it might be able to help me out.  On linux, you&#8217;ve got a couple of choices for that, you can run in console mode, which is really fast, but greatly restricts the amount of information you can have on the screen.  You can run with a lightweight window manager that puts no borders on the windows, such as <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">ratpoison</a> &#8211; but this would require me to restart my X-session, which while probably good, is not what I was looking for.</p>

<p>Then I remembered something from <a href="http://www.burtonini.com/">Ross Burton</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> hacker extraordinairre, <a href="http://www.burtonini.com/blog/computers/devilspie">Devil&#8217;s Pie</a>. This little tool lets you write a bunch of s-expressions to match windows and do funky things with them, like minimize them, move them a particular desktop, remove them from the task list, etc.  It was originally intended to be a replacement for the fact that Metacity doesn&#8217;t support matched windows like <a href="http://sawmill.sourceforge.net/">Sawfish</a> used to.  Normally you start up Devil&#8217;s Pie in the background of your session and it watches for windows that match a set of scripts you feed it.  This little Devil&#8217;s Pie script should take care of that:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cl'><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; simple devils pie to cause emacs windows to go all full screen</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;; no distractions is good!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">or</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">contains</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">window_class</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;emacs&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">contains</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">window_class</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;Emacs&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">undecorate</span> <span class="nv">fullscreen</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, this is not exactly what I wanted to do, I wanted to make Emacs full screen only when I told it to be full screen, not all the time.  This required some selective bash hackery to start up Devil&#8217;s Pie with an icon click and then kill it when it had finished it&#8217;s work.  This little script does that:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># simple script that will full-screen mode your emacs session</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># see http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/15/fake-fullscreen/</span>
</span><span class='line'>devilspie -a <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/emacs/emacs-maximize.ds &amp;
</span><span class='line'>sleep 2
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">kill</span> %1 2&gt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null

<p>Saving these scripts as <code>emacs/emacs-maximize.ds</code> and <code>emacs/emacs-maximize.sh</code> should do the trick for you.  Then create an icon on your panel that launches the second script, and voila.  Click and full screen for your emacs session.</p>

<p>I had given some thought to making an unmaximize icon, however I decided that if I maximized the window full screen it was probably for a very good reason, and I shouldn&#8217;t make it that easy to unmaximize it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday was a <a href="/weblog/weblog/random/bye-bye-kirby.xml">sad day for baseball</a>
with the surprise death of <a href="http://www.minnesotatwins.com/">Twins</a>
legend Kirby Puckett.  If something happens to Cal Ripken in the next few days,
I&#8217;m just going to curl up in a ball and give up on baseball.  However, today
something good also happened, unfortunately, it taints the sports of baseball.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/03/06/news.excerpt/index.html">Barry Bonds used drugs</a>.  I <a href="weblog/mlp/barryBondsIsADruggie.xml">talked about this over a year ago</a>.  If the allegations are true,
which lets face it, look at the pictures of him and tell me they&#8217;re not true,
then he deserves to be banned from baseball and have EVERY award stripped from
him.  If they find that other players took steroids, they deserve the same
punishment.   Pete Rose only bet on games, these guys ruined the game.  No, I
think banning them for life might be too easy on them.  For so many kids, people
like Bonds have ruined baseball.  And that makes me very sad.</p>

<p>On the positive side, its a good day beacuse Bonds is exposed for the fraud
that he&#8217;s always been.  A worthless, jealous, shell of man who took post-menopausal drugs drugs to cover up for his steroid problem.  Sorry Barry, you&#8217;re no
good.  Sulk away, enjoy those trophies for a little while longer, because
they&#8217;re going to disappear soon enough.  You&#8217;ll never make it to Cooperstown,
unlike the real hero we lost yesterday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week <a href="/weblog/weblog/computers/sun/sun-fire-t2000.xml">I submitted a try and buy request to Sun</a> for some equipment to us on some research
projects at school.  In particular, I&#8217;m excited about using it to scan the
network for spyware.  I was a little worried that my information was not
processed properly as I got a brief error message upon submission of the
request.  No problem, email my <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/pwags">personal Sun representive</a> (aka my brother), and see what&#8217;s going on.
After a few messages were passed around, I got an phone call from Sun today
about the project.</p>

<p>As I thought, the machines are way backed up because of the massive response
to their admittedly very cool offer.  I explained our situation to their
educational sales person for the Pittsburgh area (note to Sun web folks, I
could not easily find this information on your web site.  Instead Phil had to
contact the sales person for the University of Minnesota who forwarded my
information to the nice person here in Pittsburgh) and she seemed quite
receptive and reassured me that Sun was processing the stuff and that our
purpose seemed pretty novel and interesting.  So, we&#8217;re still in the queue,
but it should be all good from here.</p>

<p>She could have just left it at that, but she didn&#8217;t.  She also was helpful
enough to provide us information about Sun matching grants for hardware.  This
drops the price of a 4 core box down to a more reasonable $3800 or so.  Pretty
nice.  However, we still don&#8217;t have that much money, at least not yet.  Anyway,
if this can run on $3800 hardware, I&#8217;d think that it makes things a whole lot
more attractive for doing some sustained testing on the system.  We&#8217;ll just have
to see how well everything actually runs on it.</p>

<p>Once this thing shows up I&#8217;ll be sure to blog some more and provide some
photos of the system along with preliminary benchmarks.</p>
