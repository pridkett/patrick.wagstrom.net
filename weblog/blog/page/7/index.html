  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a followup to my original article on <a href="/weblog/weblog/linux/open-source-screencasting.xml">Open Source Screencasting with VNC in GNOME</a> from a few days ago.  Since then, I&#8217;ve been on a bit of an adventure learning about Flex, ActionScript, and finding out ways that I can manage to hack on this nifty little program with minimal pain.</p>

<p>The most important thing, is that I&#8217;ve found the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/downloads/">free Flex2 SDK</a>.  The compiler and tools appear to be written in Java, so they&#8217;ll work just fine under Linux.  Of course, there are those that will be quick to note that these tools are only free as in beer, and not Free as in speech.  This means that if you&#8217;re not a student and you can&#8217;t get your hands on FlexBuilder for free, you can still hack
on the code.</p>

<p>Thanks to these tools, I&#8217;ve been able to start modifying the original code to <a href="http://www.osflash.org/fvnc/">FVNC</a> to suit my needs as screencasting application.  Thus far, I&#8217;ve added a set of extra parameters that can be passed in the flashVars attribute of the embed tag.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>server</strong> - a servername to populate connection list with</li>
<li><strong>port</strong> - port number to connect to</li>
<li><strong>connect</strong> - set to &#8220;true&#8221; if you&#8217;d like to autoconnect based on values from server and port variables.</li>
<li><strong>hide</strong> - set to &#8220;true&#8221; if you&#8217;d like the connection dialog to automatically disappear when connect is called.</li>
<li><strong>fit</strong> - set to &#8220;true&#8221; if fitToScreen should be automatically checked</li>
<li><strong>title</strong> - set to a value for a new title in the app</li>
<li><strong>disableServer</strong> - set to &#8220;true&#8221; to disable changing server</li>
<li><strong> disablePort</strong> - set to &#8220;true&#8221; to disable changing port</li>
</ul>


<p>Thus, through some interesting use of the <strong>server</strong>, <strong>port</strong>, <strong>connect</strong>, and <strong>hide</strong> flashVars, I can make it so opening the page automatically connects to the VNC instance and allows the user to start viewing the presentation right away (or be prompted for a password first).  This really has taken the resources necessary for a remote presentation down quite a bit.</p>

<p>For my talks, I&#8217;ll probably combine this with the free conference service from <a href="http://www.gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</a>, that allows folks to dial in with regular phones and then listen to the talk and slides at the same time.  It&#8217;s a pretty slick solution.  If only there was a nice way to include a component in the modified FVNC that also channeled my voice and some video, then it would be really great.  I&#8217;d imagine there is a way to do that using some of the nifty stuff in Flex2, but I&#8217;m by no means an expert in the technology.</p>

<p>In the mean time, if folks would like my modifications, including a precompiled binary of the modified FVNC.swf program, you can get it by using git and cloning <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/git/fvnc.git">http://patrick.wagstrom.net/git/fvnc.git</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Academics end up giving lots of presentations.  Talks about results, proposals, progress, department functions.  PowerPoint and projectors are nearly ubiquitous.  A trend that&#8217;s becoming even more common is to have meetings where a portion of the group is at a remote location &#8211; such is the case almost anytime you have remote collaborators.  The typical solution in this case is to send your slides around and hope that other folks can follow along.  While this works okay, it forces the people on the other end of the line to flip through slides all the time and hope they&#8217;re on the right page.  It also forces you, as the presenter, to unnaturally announce what slide you&#8217;re on at periodic intervals.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be this bad, however.  Lots of enterprises deploy NetMeeting for remote collaboration &#8211; usually it works pretty nicely, as long as everyone is running Windows.  If you&#8217;re giving a presentation from Linux, you&#8217;re going to need something more.  As far as I know, there isn&#8217;t a solution quite as good as NetMeeting for Linux, but in this article, I show how you can create a screencast using only Open Source software.</p>

<p>The core technology behind all of this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNC">VNC</a>, which is nothing more than a simple remote framebuffer protocol.  It&#8217;s not particularly efficient, but it works pretty nicely.  In the &#8220;bad old days&#8221;, VNC under Linux required you to start a special X server.  Local interaction was done through a VNC client &#8211; which meant a laggy and unnatural feeling even while working on your own system.  Modern day GNOME has fixed this nicely with Vino.  To start sharing your desktop, go to <strong>System->Preferences->Remote Desktop</strong>.  This brings up a little window that allows you to activate the Vino desktop sharing software.  For a screencast, you&#8217;ll want to allow others to view, but not control your desktop.  Disable confirmation, and optionally require the user enter a simple password, like &#8220;abcde&#8221;, or something trite like that.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2007/12/desktopSharingPreferences.png"></p>

<p>At this point, you&#8217;ll have a VNC server that is ready to serve out to anyone who has a VNC client.  However, if you&#8217;re like most people in Academia, at least in my research field, you won&#8217;t have a VNC client installed.  There are Java VNC clients, but this is far from ideal beacuse the Java browser experience is still subpar.  Instead, we utilize a Flash based VNC client, <a href="http://osflash.org/fvnc">FVNC</a>, to do the dirty work.  It&#8217;s fast, clean, and almost everyone has flash in their browser.</p>

<p>To get there, however, you&#8217;ll need to install a simple HTTP server on your machine.  In Ubuntu run sudo apt-get install lighttpd, to install the excellent lighttpd web server.  Next, grab a copy of FVNC, and copy it to <code>/var/www/FVNC.swf</code>. As of this writing, the FVNC website has broken links to the compiled FVNC binary, so you&#8217;ll either need Adobe Flex or just trust that <a href="/weblog/resources/flash/FVNC.swf">this copy of FVNC.swf</a> is legit.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to tell lighttpd to use <code>FVNC.swf</code> as the index page.  Open up <code>/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf</code> and search for <code>index-file.names</code>.  Add <code>FNVC.swf</code> to the beginning of this list as shown below and restart lighttpd using <code>/etc/init.d/lighttpd restart</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='lighty'><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">## files to check for if .../ is requested</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">index-file.names</span>           <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="s2">&quot;FVNC.swf&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;index.php&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;index.html&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                                   <span class="s2">&quot;index.htm&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;default.htm&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                                   <span class="s2">&quot;index.lighttpd.html&quot;</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, you should be able to open up your browser and go to <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> and be greeted with the FVNC connection screen.  It defaults to some random IP address, you&#8217;ll want to enter in localhost at this point
for testing.  A password prompt comes up and after entering your password, a copy of your screen pops into view (be careful about where you place the window as this can cause a nice infinite tunnel effect.</p>

<p>Now, before giving your talk, if you know what IP you&#8217;ll have, send around an email giving your IP address, and the instructions to enter the IP address in the form and the password.  With very little work, your remote colleagues will be watching your presentation as you flip through the slides.  No more calling out numbers for them.</p>

<p>As an aside, I do not have a compiler for FVNC, but it would be great if someone could make a custom .swf file that automatically connects to a VNC server at the same IP address as the web server, that would save one more hassel and make this process pain free for remote participants.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently, Adobe provides free copies of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/productinfo/faq/#flex_faculty">Flex for students and faculty</a> just by sending them a copy of you ID card.  Pretty slick.  Now it looks like I&#8217;ll have to modify FVNC myself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This year my family finally decided to stop trying to shop for everyone and instead just draw names to see who is giving presents to whom.  In the past I&#8217;ve been at such name drawing events and they always seem to have issues, such as two person cycles or when someone is supposed to buy a gift for someone they don&#8217;t really know that well.  It&#8217;s also a little hard for us to draw names because we live so far from family.</p>

<p>Seeking to alleviate those problems, this year I wrote a little python script that takes care of all those problems for us.  The lines for names and invalidpairs are what you&#8217;ll want to customize.  names is just a list of all the people that should be drawn.  invalidpairs a list for each individual of who they should not be able to draw.
Because we assume that spouses are already exchanging gifts, they&#8217;re in the lists.  Also, my wife throught it strange that our parents wouldn&#8217;t get presents from us, so I made it so spouses can&#8217;t give to our parents, although they still can receive.</p>

<p>The program itself is pretty straight forward.  Basically, keep on iterating until it finds a combination of people that works, starting with a new random individual each time.  Once person A draws     person B, make it so person B cannot draw person A.  The program doesn&#8217;t do anything to ensure that you&#8217;ve given it a combination
of restrictions that works, however.  So it can run forever.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems to have worked okay for our family, maybe it will work for your family too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.org/">Ubuntu</a> has been incredibly successful in large part thanks to its ease of use and great packaging.  However, one thing they don&#8217;t teach you is how to force your <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> session to export environment variables to processes.  When a process is launched from a terminal, you set these environment variables through <code>.bash_profile</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.login</code> or other similar files.  You can&#8217;t simply do this in GNOME.</p>

<p>The problem I&#8217;m facing is that I need a way to set a JAVA_HOME environment variable in emacs.  The naïve method is to create a launcher with the command <code>JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.6.0 emacs</code>, after all, such syntax works from the shell and launches Emacs with the variable set.  However, the launcher mechanism in GNOME does not recognize this and will fail to launch.</p>

<p>The solution lies in a file that no one ever talks about, .gnomerc.  If you add the following lines to it, you should be able to export that variable to all applications launching in GNOME:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">JAVA_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/local/java/jdk1.6.0
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span>JAVA_HOME
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is the same syntax you&#8217;ll expect in bash, so if you use bash, you may be able to get away with symlinking <code>.gnomerc</code> from <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I gave a talk to <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> on <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  I think it ended up going pretty well and it was quite well attended.  Most people seemed interested in seeing what they could do with scavenging some computers and trying to get started with MythTV on the cheap.  That&#8217;s pretty easy if you just want to go standard def: pick up a WinTV PVR-150 card and you&#8217;ll be on your way.  If you want to go high def, you&#8217;ll need a bit faster of a processor, the kind that most people may need to purchase a new system for.</p>

<p>On of the things that I think was really helpful was a set of slides I put together on questions to ask yourself before building a MythTV box.  In hopes that this helps some other folks, I&#8217;ve <a href="/weblog/misc/20071020-WPLUG-MythTV.pdf">posted the entire set of slides here</a>.  Unfortunately, most of the talk was demonstrating MythTV to everyone, so you&#8217;ll lose some context there.  I&#8217;ll try to answer questions if possible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most modern packaged based operating systems have a facility for easily allowing remote systems to pull down updates.  In the Windows world this is primarily used for distributing bug fixes and security patches through the Windows Update system, although major service packs may introduce new features. In Linux, depending on distribution and configuration, the system may download security and bug fixes, or it may download new versions of software running on the system.  In particular, this is useful for running the development versions of distributions.</p>

<p>On Windows the patches typically come with cryptic names and descriptions and don&#8217;t provide much of a clear description what they do.  A patch is incremental against a known state of the operating system and includes logic to update to the new state.  On Linux the updates come as complete new packages that can be independently installed.  While this removes some of the dependency issues and allows one to install the updates as a complete package, it is often wasteful, especially when the system is going through massive updates as is the case right before major system releases.  For example, here&#8217;s what was presented to me this morning:</p>

<p>Liquid error: ClassNotFound: no lexer for alias &#8216;shell&#8217; found</p>

<p>This update was going to download 295 packages that were around 180MB. It actually claimed to free up some space on my hard drive when it was done.  Luckily, I was on campus so the download actually went pretty fast.  But, really, what was being accomplished?  Was it really necessary to download 180MB of updates for changes that aren&#8217;t even perceptible to me?  I decided to find out.</p>

<p>Before performing the system update I got a list of all the files to be updated and saved a copy of the information.  I also calculated the md5sums of the files and saved the file size for each file in each package to be updated.  Next, I ran the system update and got a list of the files from the new packages, md5sums, and size of the files.  I compared the two sets of information to see what files were actually updated, what files were new, and what files were removed.  Finally, I made a &#8220;dummy&#8221; archive of the updated and new files by copying them into a directory and calculating the size of a tarball of those files. This is a rough estimate for the size of a incremental package.</p>

<p>The total size of all packages downloaded was 160.33MB, when unpacked these files took up 452.37MB, versus 476.14MB before the update; about what apt indicated I would save. However, this is not the complete story. apt caches the previously downloaded files in /var/cache/apt/archive.  In reality, my drive now has an extra 136.61MB of data stored on it because of the saved packages.  Although, it is safe to delete those packages in most cases.</p>

<p>While drive storage is a concern, it&#8217;s actually pretty minor.  Drive space is really cheap and a couple of hundred megs here or there don&#8217;t make much of a difference.  However, transferring all that data is what consumes my time.  Surely it&#8217;s not the case that everything in each one of those packages was new.  To examine this, I plotted the number of files in the package versus the number of files the incremental update modified.  The correlation is 0.43, which isneither high nor low &#8211; some correlation is to be expected because the number of modified files can never go higher than the number of files in the package.  The fact that the correlation isn&#8217;t higher means that many packages are sending files that don&#8217;t need to be updated.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2007/09/dpkgTotalFilesVsModifiedFiles.png" alt="total files vs modified files plot" /></p>

<p>For many people, correlations and log-log plots may not be the most helpful in understanding what is going on, so lets visualize this another way.  Below is a histogram showing how many packages had what percentage of files modified.  It&#8217;s pretty clear that most packages had only a small fraction of files modified.  In many cases, 80% of the files transmitted had no changes at all.  Multiply that across multiple incremental updates, and that&#8217;s a lot of wasted bandwidth and
disk space.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2007/09/dpkgPercentageModifiedHistogram.png" alt="histogram of percentage of files modified" /></p>

<p>After seeing the histogram, some folks will argue that updates are more likely to larger files, so we&#8217;re not really wasting as much bandwidth.  After all, looking at many packages, such as bash, the largest files are often binaries
and libraries &#8211; those that are most likely to be changed in the incremental updates.  To understand this, I wrote a script to create dummy incremental packages.  Basically, I copied all of the files that were modified into a new directory, created a tarball of the files, and examined the size of the executable.  This is only a rough estimate of the size as I did not create a dpkg, so it&#8217;s missing the associated overhead there and estimates of bandwidth saved may be a bit optimistic.</p>

<p>The total size of all the dummy packages was 76.35MB, a savings of almost 84MB, or 53% of the original size.  It&#8217;s like a double speedup in your download speeds.  In addition, we save a bit a disk space, and the bandwidth requirements for update sites are diminished significantly.  Not all updates compressed the same amount, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2007/09/dpkgPercentageHistogram.png" alt="histogram of percentage of incremental package size" /></p>

<p>About a sixth of the smaller packages would be under 10% of the downloaded package size, while another sixth of the packages would have little change in their size.  The rest of the packages have a pretty uniform distribution.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m proposing here is a form of incremental packaging &#8211; it&#8217;s apparently one of the key features of the <a href="http://www.foresightlinux.org/">Foresight Linux</a>.  Their system is built on top a pretty cool packaging system called conary, but I don&#8217;t think that <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org/">Ubuntu</a> will adopt it any time soon.  <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> folks will consider it to be some kind of conspiracy and either choose not to implement a change, or it will take them 10 years to do it.</p>

<p>There may be a way to accomplish this with the only slight modifications to the current dpkg infrastructure by taking some hints from digital video compression. In video compression, the entire frame is not encoded from one frame to another, rather only the incremental changes are stored.  Once in a while, depending on configuration usually from every 0.5 - 3 seconds a key frame comes along.  This key frame is a complete re-encoding of the image and the next frame is based off the changes from the key frame.  The process repeats until the next key frame comes along.</p>

<p>This results in some great compression especially when the changes in a scene are small, however can take a hit when changes are significant.  That&#8217;s why if you look closely at HDTV signals in action films you can see some little blocks.  Basically the encoding is basing it off a key frame and there is a lot of data to re-encode at a low bitrate.  I&#8217;m simplifying here, but hopefully you get the picture.</p>

<p>As far as dpkg goes, a similar situation could be created.  Periodically package managers could roll a new &#8220;key frame&#8221; version of a package, such as when a new official release of a package is made.  When security updates, or bug patches are made, a incremental package would be generated with only the changes from the &#8220;key frame&#8221; &#8211; this differs from digital video in that video works from the last incremental frame.  The reason to differ from the &#8220;key frame&#8221; is because we can&#8217;t assume that everyone has obtained the entire stream of packages, like we usually can with video.  The information on the &#8220;key frame&#8221; package name can be stored in the package information and it could be automatically downloaded from the same source.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where it could get interesting.  When first installing a package, you&#8217;ll end up taking a bit of a hit if you&#8217;re not installing a &#8220;key frame&#8221; because you&#8217;ll need both the incremental package and the key frame.  However, when upgrading you&#8217;ll save some nice bandwidth.</p>

<p>The astute reader may note that this requires you to keep a copy of the &#8220;key frame&#8221; package around, which makes some of the savings a little moot.  There are a couple of different ways to address this.  One is to create an archive cache on the system.  When an incremental package makes modifications to a file from a &#8220;key frame&#8221; package, the original &#8220;key frame&#8221; version would be saved and probably compressed somewhere. Then when upgrading to a new incremental package,
dpkg would roll back the last package and apply the new one.  The  roll back configuration means we won&#8217;t have to save files from an incremental package that another incremental package modified.  Another option is to keep a listing of the files changed somewhere and download the &#8220;key frame&#8221; package if there are enough changes that the incremental package can&#8217;t deal with it.</p>

<p>As far as distributing the operating system on physical media, this change shouldn&#8217;t make any difference &#8211; all of the packages on the CD/DVD would be &#8220;key frames&#8221; that work independently.  When upgrading and applying security fixes we&#8217;d save a lot of bandwidth.  However, a down side is that such a technology is not very well suited for locations with very low bandwidth as an incremental package without a &#8220;key frame&#8221; is rather useless.  I haven&#8217;t quite figured out how this could work with platforms like the OLPC, but hopefully it&#8217;s a start.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday in my post about <a href="/weblog/weblog/linux/what-you-should-love-about-gutsy.xml">things to love in Ubunty Gutsy</a>, I talked a little bit about how great it was to have Xrandr 1.2 finally available on my Laptop.  There&#8217;s a little graphical utility to setup the screens under Xrandr 1.2 called <a href="http://gitweb.freedesktop.org/?p=xorg/app/grandr.git">grandr</a>.  However, it had some critical flaws, mainly it crashed on my machine and didn&#8217;t remember the layout of the screens at all.  This made it less than ideal.</p>

<p>Luckily, after a little bit of hacking, I&#8217;ve managed to improve the program to the point where it&#8217;s usable and even has a bit of remembering where the displays are currently located.  It&#8217;s not perfect by any means, but it works well enough for me.  If you&#8217;re interested in pulling down my latest changes you can do that using:</p>

<pre><code>git clone http://patrick.wagstrom.net/git/grandr.git
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m still pretty new to this whole <a href="http://git.or.cz">git</a> thing, so I may have mucked something up, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that will get you my master trunk.  If you have questions, feel free to email me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The newest releast of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, codenamed Gutsy Gibbon, is less than a month away.  In preparation for manning the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> booth at <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/">Ohio LinuxFest</a>, I recently upgraded my laptop to the latest development release of Ubuntu Gutsy.  This newest release features GNOME 2.20, kernel 2.6.22, and OpenOffice.org 2.3, amongst other things. This isn&#8217;t meant to be a complete review of Gutsy, rather, its what you should like about it &#8211; mainly because it&#8217;s what I like about Gutsy.</p>

<p>One of the more controversial moves in Gutsy was enabling desktop effects by default.  No longer is XGL-based-composited-desktop-bling limited to people with too much time on their hands and access to apt repositories. If you want to disable the effects, go to System->Preferences->Appearance, and select the Desktop Effects tab.  Uncheck it to make the effects go away and return to your plain, boring, desktop experience. It&#8217;s also nice to see that Compiz has gotten smart enough to realize that it can&#8217;t run on desktops where the maximum texture size is less than the desktop resolution.  This means that on my T43p, which has an ATI card with a 2048x2048 maximum texture size, Compiz will safely back to metacity if I&#8217;m running multiple monitors.</p>

<p>Along with compositing, Gutsy supports the new xrandr 1.2 protocol.  While xrandr 1.2 breaks some older xorg.conf files, the improvement is well worth it.  In my old setup, I had a customized xorg.conf that took advantage of a few ATI settings to automatically detect the monitors connected and size the output accordingly.  Unfortunately, if I wanted the external display to be active, it needed to be connected when X started.  This caused many unnecessary restarts of X and loss of session information.  Xrandr 1.2 fixes a lot of these problems by allowing for dynamic addition of monitors and reconfiguration of those monitors.  This means that while running I can plug in a new monitor, have xrandr read the EDID information for the capabilities and configure the new display without having to restart X.  As someone who gives lots of presentations, this is a life saver.  There&#8217;s even a graphical tool, grandr, that allows you to drag and drop your monitor configuration. Grandr isn&#8217;t feature complete &#8211; I&#8217;ve found some bugs in grandr that cause it to crash and die. Look for me to post my git repository with fixes soon.</p>

<p>Another great feature for laptop users is the improved power management.  Putting my laptop to sleep and then waking it up again is much faster and more reliable. Before I was never certain what key I needed to press to get the laptop to come back to life, and even then it was unreliable.  Now I just tap the &#8220;Fn&#8221; key and the laptop comes right back to life.  Great support that just works.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the usual batch of incremental changes to the system, such as tweaked graphics, new versions of minor programs, and additional utilities to keep you happy about your shiny new Linux desktop.  GNOME 2.20 has come together as one of the most solid releases yet.  Add in a few companion programs like F-Spot and Banshee for Media and Conduit for synching your data and you&#8217;ll have a great and open desktop experience for far less than what the other guys want.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2007-09-05T10:08:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 5<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The recent demise of <a href="http://labs.zap2it.com/">Zap2it labs</a> and the subsuquent creation of <a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org/">Schedules Direct</a> was a pretty remarkable change in the MythTV community.  The community now has an almost official blessing from a TV Guide service to continue, a pretty big event for most open source projects.</p>

<p>However, due to the infrastructure of MythTV, it&#8217;s not easy to add a new TV listing service.  Rather, the change from Zap2it to Schedules Direct required all users to upgrade their copies of MythTV to the newest version of the stable branch.  Unfortunately, this version still has issues with transcoding high definition signals.  The major issue is that mythtranscode has no knowledge of the program aspect ratio.  It ends up storing pixels that aren&#8217;t needed, such as what happens when a 16:9 signal is sent in a 4:3 signal (letterboxed) or when a 4:3 signal is sent in a 16:9 signal (pillarboxed, much more common). In an ideal world, MythTV would know how to cope with these automatically when transcoding and just magically cut off the offending portions.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2007/09/mythPillarBoxed.png">

        <figcaption>Letterboxing of a Frontline episode recorded with a standard definition source </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>While the result is still acceptable, it&#8217;s not perfect and may force you to switch aspect ratios to watch the video. About a year ago, I wrote a patch for MythTV that transcoders to specify a target aspect ratio. This was against MythTV 0.20, and because the newer versions didn&#8217;t provide that many desirable features, I never updated the patch or my installation of MythTV. Facing the impending loss of guide data just days before that start of the NFL season, and only weeks before the start of the new TV season, I updated the patch for MythTV 0.20.2. You can find the <a href="http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/2581">transcoding aspect ratio patch in the MythTV Trac system</a>.</p>

<p>The patch still is far from perfect, and you&#8217;ll need some cron hackery to get it to work right. The main reason is because although MythTV allows you to create non-standard transcoder names in the frontend, it won&#8217;t let you use them for anything but the default transcoder. To get around this, you&#8217;ll need to look into your MythTV database and get the transcoder id numbers. For my system, I created a set of transcoders for 1080i, 720p, and 480i content that give me the option
of whether or not to resize on the transcode and the quality. Run the following command on your database to get a listing of the transcoders:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select * from recordingprofiles;

<p>Transcoders 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, and 33 all leave the aspect ratio unchanged.  Transcoder 30 is a transcoder that resizes 480i letterboxed content.  Transcoders 46 and 47 remove pillarboxes from SDTV signals transmitted over HD.  You&#8217;ll also notice that I have different transcoders for 1080i and 720p.  You don&#8217;t need to do this, but I have chosen to do this to avoid deinterlacing 720p signals &#8211; saving a bit of time and power.</p>

<p>The final step is to tell MythTV to periodically update the transcoders settings. I use a simple script called from cron about every 15 minutes:</p>

<p>This script forces the 1080i channels to use transcoder 28 and the 720p channels to use transcoder 31.  The last three lines are for pillarboxed programs that recorded off 720p that must be unpillarboxed. With this in the background, when transcoding I select the default transcoder and the output will be properly cropped.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, this patch also fixes issues with mythtranscode not understanding that 1080i signals are encoded as 1088 (due to MPEG files needing to be a multiple of 16 lines high) and encoding a nasty gray bar at the bottom of your 1080i transcoded vidoes. It also cuts off the top eight pixels of most recordings because Comcast normally sends junk on those lines that looks like static.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I didn&#8217;t mention on my original post that if you schedule a recording via MythWeb, there is an option to set the transcoder.  In this screenshot (click for full size), you can see where I specified the transcoder &#8220;720p SDT Resize&#8221; for use on &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221;.</p>
