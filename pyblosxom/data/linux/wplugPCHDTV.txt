The Great WPLUG pcHDTV 3000 Buy

<p>
I'm organizing a mass purchase of <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV 3000</a> HDTV tuner cards for folks in WPLUG.  The more we buy, the cheaper they
go.  I'm hoping to get an order for 10 or so.  That way we get about $25 off
per card!  Wowza!  Take a look at the <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/pwagstro/pchdtv.html">current sale status</a>.  If you're interested in a few
cards and are not a <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> member, email
me and I'll see what I can do for you.

<p>
Remember, buy them before July 1, or don't buy them at all.  Yay for the
wonderful <a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">Broadcast Flag</a>!
