PennAve 0.4 Is Coming Soon

<!-- Date: 2007-02-03 18:12 -->
<p>
I'm almost to the point where I'm ready to do a push out of the new 0.4
release of PennAve.  This release sees lots of new features and bug fixes
that make the software even better.  Most of all, it's got a UI that's
83.6% sexier than the previous version, all at the same great free cost.
It seems like most everything is working now, there are a few large known
bugs that I'm not sure if they'll get fixed before the release.  They
currently are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651523&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">slideshow does not work in IE 7</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651525&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">possible to leak information about tags</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1651528&amp;group_id=110753&amp;atid=657348">images should have alt tags</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The astute observer will notice that there are a few other bugs also
listed on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=657348&amp;group_id=110753&amp;func=browse">bug tracker page for PennAve</a>.
These are fairly minor UI bugs that I'm not going to worry about fixing right now.
If I get the chance, I'll see about tackling them, but they're not real
high priority.  Also, I'm sucky at design.
