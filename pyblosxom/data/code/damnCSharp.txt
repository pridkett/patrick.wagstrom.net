Idiocy with C#

<p>
I just wasted three hours of my life debugging some C# code because what should
have been <my:verbatim>public class RandomString</my:verbatim> was only marked
as <my:verbatim>class RandomString</my:verbatim>.  This meant it worked fine
when it was linked into the main program, but didn't like being in a seperate
assembly.  So remember kids, the <my:verbatim>public</my:verbatim> statement is
important.
