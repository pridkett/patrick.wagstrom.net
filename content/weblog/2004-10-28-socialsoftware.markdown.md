As a method of procrastination, I've started to play a little bit with forms of social software.  Namely,
I've started accounts on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), a social bookmark sharing site,
and [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/).  I'm not entirely sure how much I'll use Bloglines,
I'm moderately happy with Straw, but I understand how bloglines can be used to reduce demand on a site,
which is helpful.






The neat thing is that both of these sites make it possible to share your information, through RSS none
the less.  So now anyone can go see my [bookmarks at del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/pridkett/) or see
what [blogs I'm reading at bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/public/pridkett).  What we
really need is a way to integrate FOAF data into all of these so you can dynamically explore the
communities of people with whom you share stuff in common.  Anyway, we'll see how long I continue
on this fun spree.
