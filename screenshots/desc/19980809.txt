Just thought I would show off some cool stuff going on with my desktop.  The dock tile is entirely original and is a resul of me playing around in <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</A> for a little while.  The background was done by me finding a cool picture on the <A HREF="http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1998/18/greatest-hits-gallery.html">Hubble Space Telescope's Greatest Hits</A> page.  The stuff at the bottom is the result of some blur filters on the black forest postscript font.  Also, note the edition of an Emacs icon on my dock.  A2000 is trying to convert me.
