title: Any More pcHDTV Card Takers?

I think I flubbed up parts of the order on the
[last order](/weblog/2005/04/wplugPCHDTV2)
of [pcHDTV cards](http://www.pchdtv.com/).  Namely, I ordered 1 too
few, so I only get one card. That sorta sucks.  I'm willing to order more if we can find some other folks
to join in.  I doubt we'll get as many, but we'll see.  Anyway, if you're
interested, email me.
