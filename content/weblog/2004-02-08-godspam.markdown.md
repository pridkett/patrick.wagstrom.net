I don't really need to write much to explain this piece of spam.  It's just
sorta strange.  Maybe someone will see it as a message from God.  For me it's
just something that CRM gave a score of -20 to, so it's spam.

Tomorrow is promised to nobody.

Get God in your life today do not put this off.

Call a prayer line or contact a local church today,

You will be glad you did when you are in heaven,

you will certainly regret it if you end up in hell.
