After much frustration I've decided that no matter how many bells and whistles the [MSI K8N-Neo4 Platinum](http://www.msi.com.tw/program/products/mainboard/mbd/pro_mbd_detail.php?UID=637) has, it still can't make up for the fact that I get some crazy bad electormagnetic interference when the system is under heavy load.  At first I thought it was just going to be on the pcHDTV HD-3000 card, but today during the Steelers game, while I was watching the game while it was recording and had commercial flagging running and the MPEG file just started to crap out.  Then blammo, MythTV died.  This is really annoying.  It doesn't appear to actually mess up data on the bus, just the ability of the tuners to pull in channels using internal tuners.

After three weeks of fighting, vengeance will be mine.  I'm returning the board and getting a new [ASRock 939Dual-SATA2](http://www.asrock.com.tw/product/product_939Dual-SATA2.htm) board instead.  This requires me to pick up a firewire card too and means that all the slots will be filled up from the get go.  But whatever, we'll see how this works.  I may have to do another return if that doesn't work well.
