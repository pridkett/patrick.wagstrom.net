The Uber cool [Seth Nickell](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/), previously of [storage](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/storage-speaking-notes) fame has released some [AMAZING videos of what's coming up in the desktop for Linux](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog//xshots).

To sum it up in a nutshell, Owen Taylor, of GTK fame, has written a cracktastic GL compositing X server where everything is rendered as a GL texture, ala Mac OS X.  This allows us to do all sorts of cool stuff with the desktop, just like Mac OS X does.  Also, he shows off some of the really cool progress that is being made in integrating [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/) with [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) for great vector rendering on the Linux desktop.  Go watch to videos.  Grab the [theora](http://www.theora.org/) versions for extra goodness.
