I just found out about [WeirdMind
](http://www.tam.cornell.edu/Computer/remoteaccess/weirdmind/).  It's a pretty
cool program, combines an SSH1 client with a the
[WeirdX](http://www.jcraft.com/weirdx/index.html) Java XServer implementation.
So I can plop down an HTML file on my server and get full X access.  That's
pretty sweet.  Far better than VNC, in my opinion.
