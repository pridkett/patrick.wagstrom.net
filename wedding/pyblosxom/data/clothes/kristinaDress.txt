Kristina Has a Dress

Kristina went out shopping for a wedding dress today and managed to find one.
This is a pretty big relief for both of us, although I must admit, it's a
little disappointing because that means she's got the up and I need to
start looking at tuxes soon.  It also means that our mothers need to start
coordinating their outfits or something.
