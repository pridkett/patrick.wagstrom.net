Mono.ReadLine now on SourceForge and Freshmeat

<p>
I'm pleased to say that Mono.ReadLine now has a page on
<a href="http://mono-readline.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>
and also has a record on
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/monoreadline/">FreshMeat</a>.
I guess this means that my little repackaging is now officially
submitted to the open source world.  If I get a chance I'll make
a record on <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>.
