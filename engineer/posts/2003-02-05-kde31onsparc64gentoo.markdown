I'm currently typing this from my [KDE 3.1](http://www.kde.org/) desktop on a sunblade at [school](http://www.iit.edu/).  I've got to say, it's a very nice setup to have.  The antialiased fonts really help out a lot.  The desktop also seems fairly zippy (well, relative for a 500MHz machine of course).  I'm not sure how much of this actually has to deal with me running [Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/) or not.  Of course, I'd like to think that Gentoo is entirely responsible, as it makes me want to install it more on my computer, but I realize it's probably a combination of a lot of things.

Anyway, go "emerge kde" now.
