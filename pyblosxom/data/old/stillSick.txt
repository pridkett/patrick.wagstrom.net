Still Sick

<p>
I'm really sad, I came into work today just to synchronize the CVS repository.  I still feel like I'm having revenge of El Burrito Loco.  I slept quite a bit after I got back yesterday, but it still wasn't enough.

I think that I've got something else also, I probably need to really wash all the stuff that Simba came with because I think that some of the other animals that he was living with I'm allergic to.  So tonight he shall get a bath.  I'll try to get a digital camera and post some pictures of both the pogs soon.
