Ah yes, there's nothing like coming back from seminar to see that you've got
20 <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV tuner cards</a> waiting for you in
your office.  These were prviously written about <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/wplugPCHDTV.xml">here</a>, <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/wplugPCHDTV2.xml">here</a>, and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/wplugPCHDTV3.xml">here</a>.  In any case, they're in and I've
got a BIG ASS charge on my credit card.  Yay.

For giggles, here's some photographic proof of the cards and me with them.
Unfortunately, they come in really non-descript cardboard boxes, which makes
me a little sad as it makes the pictures a bit more boring.
