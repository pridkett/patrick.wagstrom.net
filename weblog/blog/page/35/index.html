  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to have a lot of documentation on my computer.  This comes in the form of text files, man and info pages, HTML files, a few word docs, some powerpoint slides, and a bunch of PDF documents.  The problem is that while each of these has their own searching mechanism, there isn&#8217;t one consistent mechanism for all of them.  For example say I wanted to search for &#8220;references in python&#8221; I would like to search all of the stuff including my python docs and pdf files that I have on python to try and find this.  Intuitively this doesn&#8217;t seem all that hard.  Maybe I&#8217;m just fooling myself here.  Does anyone know of a piece of software that can do this?  It doesn&#8217;t need to have a web frontend, any frontend will do just fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to <a href="http://www.legis.state.il.us/legislation/ilcs/ch720/ch720act5articles/ch720act5sub21.htm">720 ILCS 5/16-19 2B</a> (scroll down the page some), my roommate commits a class A misdemeanor on a daily basis.  How is this you ask?  Well, at our apartment we have my desktop acting as a router for all of our Internet traffic.  When he utilizes his computer, it has an IP address of 192.168.1.129, which is not routable, yet when his connections go out they show up as 66.1.1.250.  Thus, he is obscuring the source of his communication and guilty of a class A misdemeanor.  Good thing that I don&#8217;t have to NAT my connection.</p>

<p>But then I realized, that I&#8217;m still probably guilty.  Why?  Because for one of my class projects I&#8217;m writing the new version of <a href="http://www.peek-a-booty.org/">Peekabooty</a> which allows rewebbing for anonymous browsing of the Internet.  It effectively obscures the location of the request, thus making it illegal.  This is just plain retarded.  I&#8217;m writing the software to get around censorship for people in countries like Saudi Arabia and China, where I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s going to be illegal too, but why would it be illegal inIllinois?  I should note, it&#8217;s also illegal in Pennsylvania.  I knew I should have gone to the University of Minnesota or University of Texas.</p>

<p>You can find more information about these ass backwards <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/superdmca.html">Super-DMCA laws on Felton&#8217;s weblog</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, for those of you not in the know, I&#8217;ve been working on an updated version of <a href="http://www.peek-a-booty.org/">Peekabooty</a>.  This one is written entirely in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> because it makes development a lot easier.  Right now it&#8217;s not fully working yet, but a lot of the components have been laid down to make it a much better architecture. Most importantly, the new system is fully multithreaded.  This makes it a whole lot nicer than the old verison.  Still some bells and whistles that need to be cleaned up, but other than that, it&#8217;s all good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been considering getting a digital camera.  I almost bought the <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/digital/easyShare/ls443/ls443.jhtml">Kodak LS443</a> and even went out to Best Buy to look at it.  In the end, I think that God was saying no because my order didn&#8217;t go through at Buy.com.  Ho hum.  So if you have suggestions of a good 4.0MP or greater digital camera, can you post them?  I really don&#8217;t want to spend more the $400 for the setup.  The total for the 443 and a 256MB SD card was going to be right around $400.</p>

The problem is that Pennsylvania is ass backwards and has a law that says that I can&#8217;t bring <a href="/weblog/hedghogs/">my hedgehogs</a> with me.  So if you might be interested in giving either one a home, let me know.  Thanks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went out and say <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/miyazaki/index2.html">Spirited Away</a> and must say that it was a most triumphant movie.  It was so interesting how it tended to blur the lines between good and evil. The animation was pretty impressive too.  This is the first anime that I ever have paid to see in a theatre, but I think it was well worth the price.</p>

<p>The voice acting in the movie was pretty poor, but that&#8217;s to be expected because the nice people at Disney dubbed it into English because Americans can&#8217;t read subtitles.  I&#8217;m not saying that it was poor enough to distract from the film much, but it wasn&#8217;t good enought that they added much.</p>

<p>The most astounding thing really was the story.  In the beginning when Chihiro is still new to the world is probably the part of the story that is the best as it causes you develop some questions about people.  It&#8217;s also interesting because they made No Face resemeble a lot of the other spirits that came off the boat.</p>

<p>In any case, I&#8217;m not qualified enough to write a full review, but I do suggest seeing it.  Disney pushed the movie into 800 theatres because it won the academy award for best animated picture.  Try to catch it before it&#8217;s gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My blog has been rather quite for the last few weeks.  I&#8217;ve been out and about visiting universities, my parents, and generally being sick.</p>

<p>During that time we ended up going to war with Iraq.  Oddly enough it was on March 20th, if you count the &#8220;Decapitation Strike&#8221; as the start of the war, so I guess I would win the pool.  In the end we decided that because they didn&#8217;t start out with &#8220;shock and awe&#8221; that it was too hard to tell when the war actually started and declared the pool moot.</p>

<p>Anyway, this leaves me in a bit of an interesting position.  I don&#8217;t support the war and I do believe that Bush and his buddy Blair could have done more before going to war.  However, the time for complaining and writing my senators is over.  There really isn&#8217;t anything that can be done at this juncture.  Men, women, and children are going to die because of this war.  Some of them rather needlessly.  It&#8217;s hard to say whether the world will be a better place after this war or not.  It depends on how much it expands, and how much support we continue to gather for it.</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that it is not mutually exclusive to support our troops and be against the war.  Our troops are deployed by the commander in chief of the United States armed forces.  They don&#8217;t have a choice in their deployment.  I feel that those who are not supporting the troops are a little ungrateful for the sacrafices they do make day after day.</p>

<p>So how does one support our troops and not support the war?  Well, when people ask me, I make it very clear the situation that most of the troops are in.  Secondly, when people make verbal attacks on our military, I ask them if they mean that against the military or against the administration.  Usually it&#8217;s the latter rather than the former.  Thirdly, I pray for the troops.  That they might return home to their families quickly and that they might help the peopel of Iraq end the horrible suffering of this war.</p>

<p>It seems like it can&#8217;t work at first glance, but I firmly believe it can.  I support our troops, but I think that our administration is perhaps a bit misguided and shortsighted with some of the decisions they have made regarding foreign policy.  I can&#8217;t say that I know everything, so maybe they have some &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; that I can&#8217;t see, but from my perspective, that&#8217;s the way the world is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m sure this has got to be a violation of some sort of law, probably related the FERPA.  I got this email from some random people outside of IIT today:</p>

<pre><code>Hello,

Welcome! You have been registered in your university/college ELMS
for MSDNAA online software system. Here you can download and
access a wide range of Microsoft developer tools, servers, and
platforms. There is no charge to download the software as long
as you are an eligible user in the System.

How Does it Work?

Your university/college is licensed under the MSDN Academic
Alliance Program which enables eligible students and faculty
members to access software available under the Program. e-academy
Inc., a partner of Microsoft, is providing ELMS for MSDNAA to you.
Simply log into the System using your username and password
included below and start browsing/ordering the software
available to you.

Your MSDNAA Online Software System can be found at:
http://msdn03.e-academy.com/iit_cs
</code></pre>

<p>The mail goes one for a few more paragraphs and even has my username and password in plaintext.  This is a problem in several ways.  First of all, this data is a marketing gold mine for e-academy or whoever.  Knowing that not only are these people college students, but they also are computer science graduate students can be worth a lot of money.  Furthermore they can track what software students use to a greater degree than I think anyone would like to admit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just really pissed off that my university would distribute my information in such a way.  It makes me wonder what other sort of information they have given away (I use that term because the MSDNAA program costs money).  I have no intention of using the software and will not participate in the program.  I need to go bitch at a real person I guess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s more than a little ironic that the <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> said that the broadcast flag was about &#8221;<a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000306.html">Keeping Honest People Honest</a>&#8221;.  Felton makes a good point about the whole definition of honesty.  It&#8217;s even more interesting when on considers some of the things that the MPAA has done and said in the past.  Hardly a group of people who I would call honest.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Break out your pens my freedom loving friends and write your senator.  It seems that it is illegal for me to modify a piece of hardware that I own.  That&#8217;s right, today the USDOJ siezed control of <a href="http://www.isonews.com/">isonews.com</a>.  The owner had been selling mod chips that allow people to play any game on their XBox.  The DOJ has a <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2003/February/03_crm_118.htm">press release</a> online about the whole thing.</p>

<p>Here is what bugs me about this.  I don&#8217;t own an X-Box, and we&#8217;ll skip the part about how I think people who own an X-Box should be thrown in jail.  That aside, this is a lot like making a VCR illegal as that allows you to play any movie over and over again without renting it again.  But it also has legitimate purposes.  The Enigmah mod-chips he was selling allowed you to play back ups and any region DVDs.  This is hardly illegal.  I&#8217;ve got a few old CDRom games for PC that are all scratched up and no longer playable, if I had been really worried, I could have burned copies of them.  Pretty straight forward.  But apparently, giving people the ability to do that is now illegal.</p>
