title: September 11th as a Political Device

Like most people, I find how both parties are using September 11th as
a political device morally apalling.  I also find the purple heart stickers
that republican delegates are wearing a disgrace and shameful.  But back to
the main topic.  The New York Times  has an
[interesting article](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/01/politics/campaign/01about.html) about the lives of a lot of the former workers at Windows
on the World, the restaurant on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center.
It's an interesting contrast between them and what the delegates are saying.
