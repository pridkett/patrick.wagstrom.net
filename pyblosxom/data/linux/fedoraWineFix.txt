Fixing Wine Under Fedora

<!-- Date: 2004-02-13 16:23 -->
<p>
Fedora ships with a lot of nice security patches which make the system more secure,
at least in theory.  But the problem is that when running apps under Wine, a lot
of them will die because they have a hard coded location to start their data
segment at.  Luckily, <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2004/01/0971.html">there is a fix</a>.  First edit your <my:verbatim>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</my:verbatim> to have the following line:</p>
<pre>PRELINK_OPTS="-m --no-exec-shield"</pre>
<p>
Then run the following two commands (they'll take a while):
</p>
<pre>prelink -au
prelink -a
</pre>
<p>
You won't have exec shield support, but if you need access to some windows programs
through Wine this looks like the easiest way to get it.
