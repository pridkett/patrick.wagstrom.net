  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s become the in-vogue thing for experts on various issues to pontificate on events for the coming year.  As I&#8217;m now a Dr. and I received my doctorate for studying the socio-technical aspects of software engineering communities, I feel like I&#8217;m legitimately qualified to put forth predictions about Open Source, Free Software, and web technologies. Putting a prediction in this list does not necessarily mean that I want it to happen, merely that I think there is a significant chance it will happen.    I&#8217;m not an insider on any of these issues, but here&#8217;s what I think will happen in 2010, in rough order of likelihood:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Foundation</a> will undergo a major upheaval related to community/corporate structure and governance.This follows from some of the results of <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/thesis/">my Ph.D. research</a> and also from more <a href="http://eclipse-projects.blogspot.com/2009/11/its-trade-association.html">recent posts from Bjorn Freeman-Benson</a>.  Much of this will arise from the structure of Eclipse as a 503c6 trade association and the lack of individual participation relative to commercial control of development.</p></li>
<li><p>Highly customized hardware running on Open Source will continue to under-perform.  In particular, <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">OLPC</a> will continue to be a yawn with most people questioning the long term value of the project over basic needs, resulting in no new deployments of more than 150,000 units and <a href="http://www.litl.com/">Litl</a> will be too different for most people to understand and will fold.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite the pleas of Open Source users and zealots, Netflix will continue to be inaccessible from open platforms. This isn&#8217;t a Netflix issue, it&#8217;s related to the content providers who want their content to be protected.  Until Open Source can provide a suitable way to protect this content it will continue to lag behind. Therefore, for the most part, Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>As Netflix becomes more dominant in the streaming market this may lead to some firms claiming that Netflix is abusing it&#8217;s power as a market leader by not providing open access to their streams.  These people will have a fundamental misunderstanding of both the cause for Netflix requiring Silverlight and the duties of a market leader in an unregulated market.</p>

        <figcaption>While this would be awesome, it ain&#8217;t gonna happen. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/box">Boxee Box</a> will be greeted with lots of nerd hype, but will ultimately lose out to more flexible HTPC solutions based on Intel&#8217;s Pinetrail and nVidia&#8217;s Ion 2.This is largely related to the previous two predictions, but addresses broader issues of media convergence.  I&#8217;m excited about the Boxee Box, but I&#8217;ve seen too many great devices fail because of various problems.  Without a huge marketing blitz and without the ability to work as a Windows Media Center extender or record live TV, the beautiful Boxee Box will underperform as nerds op for a faster, more open platform.</p></li>
<li><p>Google will suffer a major privacy leak and be very very quiet about the issue.  Some will say this will hurt Google, but in the long run nothing will change.  Google is too careful and conscientious about it&#8217;s position to allow this to happen to GMail.  It&#8217;s much more likely that this will occur in a smaller service such as Google Voice or Picasa.</p></li>
<li><p>Tensions between Open Source developers and the Free Software Foundation will continue to grow, resulting in at least one major community issuing a formal statement about community and inclusiveness that puts it directly at odds with the Free Software Foundation.  We&#8217;ve seen some signs of these issues, particularly in the GNOME community, which expressed outrage over <a href="http://opensourcetogo.blogspot.com/2009/07/emailing-richard-stallman.html">Richard Stallman&#8217;s actions at the Gran Canaria Desktop Summit</a> and also in a series of messages on various <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/22610/GNOME_To_Split_from_GNU_Project_">GNOME mailing lists in December</a>.  I&#8217;m not certain if it will be GNOME, but they are the community I&#8217;ve followed most closely on these issues.</p></li>
</ol>

    </figure>


<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> will encounter difficulties related to the foundation&#8217;s reliance on corporate sponsors and the rise of alternative platforms.  GNOME was making excellent progress in the mobile space, especially with the maemo platform.  Unfortunately, Android may be a force too powerful for GNOME to compete against. Some of this loss will be offset by the increasing interest in netbooks and cloud based services, however such gains will be short lived as Android moves into netbooks and Google releases Chrome OS.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> will remove at least one major application in favor of directing users toward a cloud based solution.  I have no idea what application this might be.  For end users I could easily see them removing Evolution, however it is too entrenched in the desktop at the enterprise level.  My best bet is that the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/11/giving-up-the-gimp-is-a-sign-of-ubuntus-mainstream-maturity.ars">dumping of GIMP for F-Spot</a> will go poorly and Ubuntu 10.10 will direct users to an online application for photo editing and management.</p></li>
<li><p>The issue of ownership rights of open source software that originated with one author, and was later updated by another who progressively removed all of the original author&#8217;s code will come to the forefront resulting in threats of, but no actual, legal challenges.We&#8217;ve seen the beginnings of this with <a href="http://perens.com/blog/2009/12/15/23/">Bruce Perens and Rob Landley spatting over BusyBox</a>.  I&#8217;d imagine that the future challenge will come as the result of a commercial firm using an Open Source project as scaffolding to build a new project, eventually removing all the original Open Source software and then changing the license to something decidedly less open.</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial ventures will continue to shy away from the GPL in favor of more standard Apache or BSD licenses.  At least one major project/community will begin the process of transitioning to more business friendly licensing.  We&#8217;ve seen how more open solutions (I consider the BSD to be more free than GPL) have been gaining traction, especially in the web frameworks market. It&#8217;s only a matter of time until a community begins to recommend that all projects adopt something like the BSD.  Despite this success, trolls will continue to insist that BSD is dying.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I&#8217;ll revisit these predictions as we turn the calendar to 2011.  Given the probability estimates in my head I&#8217;d say that five of these will come true with my 95% confidence interval between 2 and 7.  However, this is my first attempt at prognostication, so go easy on me in December 2010 when I review these, okay?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Christmas day a young Nigerian man boarded a flight from Lagos to Amsterdam and then later boarded a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.  About an hour outside of Detroit, as the plane was descending over Canadian airspace he decided that his religion would martyr him if he blew up the plane using a slab of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (aka PETN) taped to his crotch.  Unfortunately for him and fortunately for the plane&#8217;s passengers the igniter failed and he merely started his crotch on fire and probably blew up his testicles.</p>

<p>As expected, the TSA felt a need to respond to yesterday&#8217;s threat today.  Apparently it is now a threat to have more than one carry on, electronics in the main cabin on international flights, anything in your lap, and to go to the bathroom within one hour of the flight landing. I&#8217;ll leave the sanity of these for other people.  What I&#8217;m interested in is the way that the TSA shared this information.</p>

<p>The primary way that travelers are told to stay up to date on the ever changing regulations regarding flight security is to visit the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">TSA home page</a>.  Here&#8217;s a screen capture of the home page from December 27th, more than 48 hours after the incident on Northwest 253:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2009/12/TSAWebsiteFail.png"></p>

<p>The TSA has a statement on flight 253, but there is nothing about the new flight restrictions, despite the fact that I&#8217;m sure that I, and thousands of other people, were concerned about how their flights home may be impacted.</p>

<p>The digerati may have also checked Twitter for information.  The TSA doesn&#8217;t have an official Twitter feed, but their blog team has a Twitter feed.  Here&#8217;s a screen capture of the Twitter feed taken at the same time:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/media/2009/12/TSATwitterFail.png"></p>

<p>There is a link to an <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/12/dhs-statement-on-northwest-airlines.html">article on the TSA&#8217;s blog about Northwest 253</a>, but the article is merely the official statement and contains nothing about the changing regulations.  For more than 48 hours passengers were left to wonder about the changing regulations and how these regulations impact travel in the holiday season. The primary source of the changing regulations was a message on <a href="http://www.aircanada.com/en/news/trav_adv/091226_3.html">Air Canada&#8217;s web site</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, late on the 27th the actual text of the regulations was finally made available, but not through an easy source on TSA&#8217;s website.  Instead, we&#8217;re forced to go to <a href="http://www.elliott.org/blog/full-text-of-sd-1544-09-06-authorizing-pat-downs-physical-inspection/">Christopher Elliott&#8217;s full text of the directive</a>.</p>

<p>The administration has been quiet on the issue, but I believe that is more by design.  There&#8217;s no need to send everyone off to Sunday morning talk shows because a terrorist decided to try and blow his own balls off.  What isn&#8217;t acceptable is the long delay and horrible communication regarding the new restrictions for travelers.  There&#8217;s lots more that could be written on this, but I&#8217;m trying to minimize editorializing in this article.</p>

        <figcaption>Round and Round They Go!  Where They&#8217;ll Stop, Monty Knows! </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Over the weekend the twitterwebs lit up with the #savemysql tag in response to a <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/12/help-saving-mysql.html">plea from Monty</a>, the founder of MySQL.  The basic gist of Monty&#8217;s plea are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL is a critical piece of infrastructure</li>
<li>Thousands of businesses use MySQL in functions beyond the web</li>
<li>Oracle sells a variety of competing databases</li>
<li>Oracle doesn&#8217;t have the best track record with Open Source</li>
<li>Therefore, Oracle should have to make a set of promises related to the commercial viability of MySQL.</li>
</ul>


<p>The first four are all facts that are not in dispute.  The final point is Monty&#8217;s conclusion from the facts, that, in and of itself, doesn&#8217;t sound all that bad.  If you&#8217;re the European Commission, of course you&#8217;re going to be concerned if a major tool for thousands of small and medium enterprises goes by the wayside.  This would force those companies to spend untold amounts of time and money to procure another database &#8211; one most likely provided by an American company.  Therefore, the merger between Sun and Oracle could result in a large amount of money flowing out of Europe and into the hands of the United States.</p>

<p>However, if we examine this issue a bit deeper, we see while Monty&#8217;s facts are true, the conclusion is completely unfounded.  First, the license that MySQL is distributed under is a dual license.  Anyone can download, modify, and distribute modifications the the GPL version of the database.  One the code is available under the GPL it&#8217;s forever available under that same license.  Sure, the copyright holder can change the license, but that doesn&#8217;t nullify the GPL versions of the software.  So, in that sense, MySQL cannot die from the Oracle acquisition of Sun any more than it could die from when Sun purchased MySQL AB. The dual license portion is where many people got bit by the whole thing.  Many companies believed that when they purchased a license from MySQL AB or Sun to use MySQL for purposes not covered under the GPL that they  were still getting an Open Source project.  The fact of the matter is that they were not.  The dual version of MySQL may be supported by the same tools as the Open Source version and may sound the same on the surface, but the license doesn&#8217;t guarantee the companies access to updated versions of the software.  What they were purchasing was not much different than a proprietary commercial piece of software that also has a free version.</p>

<p>For Monty to act like this is some travesty is entirely dishonest.  Of course he knew that this was the situation the whole time, he is the one who structured the MySQL licensing.  While there are a variety of companies that work in Open Source and made money from their expertise in the product area, performing consultations and developing custom extensions, MySQL AB went a step beyond this and also allowed firms to license the software out of the GPL.  This was because while other databases and packages were licensed under more business friendly licenses, the<a href="http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/admindevel326/html/apa.html"> LGPL for JBoss</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence">BSD for PostgreSQL</a>, MySQL AB licensed MySQL under the GPL to create this business opportunity.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but it has always made MySQL adoption rather dicey inside of some enterprises because even the connectors for MySQL database access were GPL&#8217;d, making any program that used those connectors GPL.</p>

<p>One might argue that this licensing scheme is what made MySQL so valuable.  It was a critical piece of infrastructure and revenue could be derived from the dual licensing, something that while possible with PostgreSQL, is not nearly as easy.  Sun thought this too and they purchased <a href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html">MySQL for about $1 billion</a>.  At this point I&#8217;m sure that Monty was now laughing all the way to the bank.  Then, oddly enough, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10033614-16.html">Monty left Sun within seven months of the purchase</a>.  Publicly stated reasons were his disagreement with Sun wanting to offer commercial extensions to some of the core of MySQL.  In February of 2009, about five months after leaving Sun, <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/02/time-to-move-on.html">Monty announced the creation of Monty Program</a>, a new software firm that oddly enough, seems to do exactly what MySQL would have been doing if they didn&#8217;t offer the dual license option.</p>

<p>However, now something was different, after the sale of MySQL AB to Sun, Monty no longer owned or had the rights to the source code.  That&#8217;s what the $1 billion in compensation was for.  Rather than being like other entrepreneurs and going into a different venture, Monty started nearly the exact same business he had before, only with a no rights to the source code.  Therein lies the problem for Monty and his call for the EC to block the Oracle purchase of Sun.  Doing so would hurt his business.  It would hurt his business because of the license that he put the software under in the first place.  It would hurt other businesses because of the ruse that he managed to play on business that didn&#8217;t completely understand Open Source licensing, and he took little effort to explain what they were purchasing.</p>

<p>Yes, a purchase of Sun by Oracle could hurt thousands of small and medium enterprises that rely on the dual licensed version of MySQL, but so will the continued downfall of Sun.  If Sun goes out of business it could put the code in legal limbo, leaving no one able to get a license for the code.  Furthermore, it&#8217;s hurting the MySQL community right now.  With Sun being in limbo right now, I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;re not winning many new customers &#8211; businesses hate uncertainty, and there isn&#8217;t much greater uncertainty than wondering if your supplier is going to be independent or not in the next few months.  This whole thing smacks of selfishness and I truly hope that the EC sees through this ruse and the all the letters they get from the internet fanboys.</p>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, then <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2009-12-14.html">Michael Meeks has helpfully pointed</a> out that <a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/mysql_connector">Sun provides an LGPL connector to MySQL</a>, but no one has actually requested the source code for it yet.  Just sayin&#8217;&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since I started on my &#8220;seekrit project&#8221; I&#8217;ve asked a few questions on programming related topics at <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.  Thus far I&#8217;ve found the answers to be really helpful.  While most people know about StackOverflow, lots of folks don&#8217;t realize that there three other sites in StackOverflow empire: <a href="http://serverfault.com/">ServerFault</a> - for system administration issues, <a href="http://superuser.com/">SuperUser</a> - for end user software issues, and <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/">Meta.StackOverflow</a> - for site related questions about StackOverflow.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/12/stackoverflow-minifigs.jpg">
        <figcaption>The Four Horsemen of the StackOverflow Empire </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Today during <a href="http://bit.ly/84eF7i">my run in Central Park</a>, I was thinking about the community that StackOverflow has.  It&#8217;s really a remarkable thing, there are thousands of users and most posts in even the most obscure topics get lots of views quickly.  If you&#8217;re lucky, you&#8217;ll even get a good answer or two &#8211; or, more likely, you&#8217;ll have someone who is smart tell you that you&#8217;re not asking the right question, and help you down the right path to rethink your problem in the correct way.  This sort of input can be really helpful in many other domains, parenting, cooking, travel, etc.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually possible to run your own StackOverflow site.  The software, <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> is available from <a href="http://fogcreek.com/">FogCreek software</a> who offer different hosted plans.  At $129/mo for the most basic plan it&#8217;s not cheap at all, but when you consider that includes everything, it&#8217;s not a horrible idea either.  It&#8217;s been a pretty decent hit so far too, the <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4/list-of-stackexchange-sites">StackExchange</a> website lists numerous sites around specific topics.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the sites that I&#8217;d really like to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>NYCLikeALocal.com: Questions and answers about the self-proclaimed greatest city in the world.  With a focus for people actually living in the city who may not be overly familiar with the city.  In other words, folks like me who live in NYC, but aren&#8217;t native.</li>
<li>RunThroughTheWall.com: Questions and answers about training for marathons and other long distance endurance sports, like IronMen triathlons.</li>
<li>SnackExchange.com: Ideas for cooking, specifically desserts.  Everyone loves deserts.</li>
</ul>


<p>After browsing through the sites, I found out that in each of the cases someone had already beat me to it.  For NYC local information there is <a href="http://pojocity.com/">PojoCity.com</a>.  For running someone created <a href="http://fit.stackexchange.com/">FitBulb</a> which covers all sports.  Unfortunately, they weren&#8217;t on the ball and let a squatter get FibBulb.com.  For cooking there is <a href="http://cooking.stackexchange.com/">cooking.stackexchange.com</a>, which probably the least branded StackExchange site in existence.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;ve contributed to FitBulb, most of the sites are rather sparse.  This could be for a variety of reasons, it&#8217;s likely that they haven&#8217;t advertised themselves enough.  StackOverflow launched and was hugely successful because Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky both had legions of followers on their weblogs.  When the site was launched there was already a huge pool of users.  By mentioning them here I&#8217;m hoping that other people will use these three StackExchange sites and help build mass.</p>

<p>The second reason why the sites may have difficulty in excelling is because they&#8217;re not generally perceived as a need.  For programming there was a definite need for a site where people could ask questions and get reasonable answers.  StackOverflow was aimed dead center at destroying ExpertsExchange, both by providing better answers, more information about people who provide answers, and not seeming all scammy. From the looks of it, they&#8217;re succeeding.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/12/google-stackoverflow-vs-experts-exchange.png">
        <figcaption>Stackoverflow will soon kill Experts-Exchange.  And the world will be a better place. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>However, most of these other domains don&#8217;t have any large community at all, so it&#8217;s up to the site developers and maintainers to build one.  This is no easy task. I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;m pretty savvy, but I haven&#8217;t seen much about communities for any of these topics.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#8217;s a small problem with the architecture of StackExchange.  I would like to vote up some posts and answers on FitBulb, but I can&#8217;t do that until I get 15 karma.  Unfortunately, when no one has any karma on the site, it&#8217;s difficult to build enough karma.  So, if the site admins hear me, vote me up some so I can support other people on your fledgling site.</p>

<p>In any case, it&#8217;s exciting to see that there are StackExchange sites for the three sites that I really hoped would exist.  I&#8217;ve already posted a bit to FitBulb and have found some useful stuff on Pojocity, but remember, community sites are only as good as the people who use them.  So visit the sites and give them some love today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a new secret project I’ve been putting together an installation of Trac to provide a web interface for task management. I found myself wanting to create a nice looking table within a Trac wiki page to document different dependencies needed by the software. In a normal installation there are three different ways to do this:</p>

<h2>Trac’s Wiki Formatting</h2>

<p>This is probably the simplest option, however it’s also the most limiting, there is no way to provide additional styling to elements and you can’t create columns that span multiple rows or columns.  The lack of additional styling is particularly difficult because you can’t correct it easily with CSS without modifying all of the tables.</p>

    </figure>


<h2>HTML</h2>

<p>HTML is of course, the go to for all of this.  However, the whole reason I started looking at this is that I didn’t want to embed a huge chunk of HTML into my wiki page.  I know I can do all the formatting I want, but this really isn’t an option.</p>

<h2>ReStructured Text</h2>

<p>ReStructured Text is the preferred markup language of Python documentation.  It’s more robust than Trac Wiki formatting, especially for tables.  The processor for ReStructured Text in Trac is smart enough to tag tables with the class ‘docutils’ which helps out immensely when trying to style the documents.  This allows for the creation of some prettier tables.  It also allows the creation of header columns and multi-column/row cells.  However, it’s not great for this sort of general purpose document, for two reasons.  First,  it doesn’t allow for a header row to appear in the middle of the table.  I’d really like these to be part of the same table.  Secondly, you can’t have multiple short links with the same name.  So, I can have the name ‘MIT’ link to two different pages without doing implicit links.  However, this introduces a new third problem, which is that table cells are proportional in width to the RST equivalent.  Here’s the sample table structured in RST:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this results in tables that are unnaturally wide and must be split into two different tables.  While the result is passable, especially after throwing down some CSS to help out and collapse those ugly borders, the width of the tables makes them look highly awkward, and therefor unacceptable.</p>

<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>Markdown is the hotness markup language that all of the web 3.0 kiddies like to use. And why not?  It’s from John Gruber, macboy extraordinairre!  Markdown is designed to be wholly readable without people needing to know how to speak HTML.  It’s quick and easy to use.  There’s a pretty good markdown processor available for Trac.  However, there are a few shortcomings.  First, by default Markdown has no support for tables, so you’ll need to drop back to HTML for the formatting.  This is less than ideal as it’s messy again.  Furthermore you cannot use Markdown inside of an HTML table.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are some extensions to Markdown that provide support for tables.  As is normal for this sort of community, it’s been further extended to allow for all sorts of crazy formatting and alignment issues.  However, as near as I can tell it still does not allow cells to span multiple columns/rows.  Or, if it does, the Markdown plugin for Trac doesn’t support it.  I didn’t really get far enough to generate anything really interesting with Markdown.</p>

<h2>Textile</h2>

<p>In the world of Web 2.0 fanboys, the other competing markup, favored by the Ruby guys and folks at GitHub, is Textile.  It’s slightly similar to Markdown, in that it aims to be fairly readable, but advanced features let you do neat stuff at the expense of some readability.  Fortunately, using Textile I was able to make the table look exactly like I wanted to.  Although Textile allows you to use multiple header rows, I did have to apply some simple CSS styling to the header columns and rows.  Here’s the Textile I used.</p>

<p>Liquid error: ClassNotFound: no lexer for alias &#8216;textile&#8217; found</p>

<p>And here is the actual output from Trac after rendering the Textile (after a little bit of help from some CSS:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/12/textile-table.png">
        <figcaption>Table output using Textile processor </figcaption>
    </figure>


<h2>Trac Textile Macro</h2>

<p>To get this far I needed to write a simple little Trac processing macro for Textile. Using information from the excellent Markdown Macro I was able to hack together a simple Textile Macro for Trac.  Before installing it you’ll need to install the Python Textile libraries.  Then, you can clone the git repository from git://github.com/pridkett/tractextilemacro.git.  From here you can install it like a normal Trac component.  Enable it in your trac.ini using these lines:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[components]
</span><span class='line'>Textile.* = enabled</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, just embed your Textile code in a block like this and you’ll be
on your way. Remove the double backslashes at the top of the block,
they&#8217;re only there because otherwise Octopress chokes.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>\\{\\{\\{
</span><span class='line'>#!Textile
</span><span class='line'> 
</span><span class='line'>Hello from the __magical__ land of "Textile":http://textile.thresholdstate.com/!
</span><span class='line'>}}}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-11-25T14:10:52-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 25<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several years ago I created a nifty little photo gallery webapp for <a href="http://f-spot.org/Main_Page">F-Spot</a> users called <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/projects/pennave">PennAve</a>.  PennAve was designed to be incredibly simple in its use: Tag a set a photos in F-Spot as &#8220;Public&#8221;, copy the database to your web server, and boom, those photos would be displayed.  It was quite simple and just worked, well for the most part.</p>

<p>However, in the design of PennAve I made a couple of critical errors and since that point the marketplace has changed significantly.  Some of these are issues that I should have be more aware of, other ones I couldn&#8217;t have anticipated.</p>

<h3>Issue 1: XML? What was I thinking‽</h3>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/11/xsltdisaster.png">
        <figcaption>At what point did I think that code like this would be a good idea? </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>At the time I was all hyped up on the XML goofballs and believed that making the whole thing styleable using client side XSLT would be an awesome idea.  It was just really neat that I could send an XML document and Firefox could transform it.  Think of the other clients I could use to slurp that data with little effort! In retrospect, trying to do any sort of significant styling using XSLT makes me feel like I&#8217;m slowly driving an ice pick into my head.  The clean syntax of XML gives way to the disaster of XSLT, templates, variables, and overly verbose syntax.</p>

<h3>Issue 2: Strange dependencies and poor documentation.</h3>

<p>PennAve required things like <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org">CherryPy</a> and <a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a> (for a while it even required a SVN version of SQLObject, scary, eh?).  Folks know how to install a PHP script, they can probably figure out how to run a Django app.  Trying to explain to everyone how to compile <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> so they could run PennAve in the web server, or use <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a> to redirect to CherryPy&#8217;s internal web server was a big pain.  I sought to make it really easy to create your galleries, but the installation bordered on insanity for some users.</p>

<h3>Issue 3: Slow development of F-Spot.</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t use F-Spot that much anymore.  I have most of my collection tagged and edited (more than 800 different tags), so I just pop in when I need to import some new photos.  However, while F-Spot was pretty good four years ago, its development is slow enough that numerous other solutions make it look ancient.  The tools for editing photos are slightly substandard. It doesn&#8217;t have face detection. It is sometimes prone to crashing. I&#8217;m not trying to blame Stephane Delcroix (the maintainer of F-Spot) for these problems, but that&#8217;s the reality of a project that only has a small community.  Perhaps these will change with <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2009/11/gimp-to-be-removed-lucid.html">Ubuntu&#8217;s decision to make F-Spot the default instead of GIMP</a>, but that&#8217;s a little uncertain.</p>

<h3>Issue 4: Cheap online storage</h3>

<p>Google recently announced that you could get 20GB of storage for $5/yr.  That&#8217;s cheap enough that you can easily manage your entire collection online.  $20 for 80GB of storage without having to worry about bandwidth and server costs is a godsend.  Reduction in prices for Flickr also affect this.</p>

<h3>Issue 5: The Awesomeness of Face Detection</h3>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/11/mugshots.jpg">
        <figcaption>Not even my ugly mug could break Picasa&#8217;s face detection </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>F-Spot has a default category of people where you can create a tag for each person.  However, this merely associates the photo with a person, not an area of a photo with a person.  Using face detection you can find people in all your photos, many times automatically.  For example, I&#8217;ve found cases where I had photos of friends from before I became friends with them.  When I put these photos in F-Spot I didn&#8217;t tag those photos, but now I&#8217;d like to do that.  Face detection takes care of that with no interaction from me.</p>

<h3>Issue 6: Geotagging</h3>

<p>Once again, F-Spot has a default category of places.  I carefully created a hierarchy of locations so I could quickly find all of my photos taken in Pittsburgh, or Pennsylvania, etc.  However, it&#8217;s much better if photos can say exactly where they&#8217;re taken, which is where geotagging is helpful.  Photos from my iPhone already are geotagged and the integration of Picasa with Google Earth and Google Maps makes it dreadfully simple to tag all of my other photos.</p>

<p>Independently none of these issues was bad enough to cause me to stop development, but in sum, they&#8217;re huge.  I never started PennAve to get hordes of fans, mainly I needed a way to show my own photos and if a few other people might find it useful, that would be great.  I&#8217;m pleased that a handful of other people have found PennAve useful, but times change and it&#8217;s time to move on.  Therefore, I&#8217;m declaring officially that I&#8217;m stopping development on PennAve.  I&#8217;ll keep the site up for the reasonable future, but I won&#8217;t make efforts to update the software or ensure the website stays operational indefinitely.  Thanks for all the help from everyone!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This past weekend I left New York City and traveled to Columbus, OH for <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/">Ohio LinuxFest</a> 2009 (OLF). Unlike many shows, such as LinuxCon and the now defunct OpenSourceWorld, OLF is entirely community run.  That means you’ll notice a couple of different things: it’s much cheaper, there’s a wider range of attendees, and while many top name speakers attend, you’ll also get a smattering of other folks making their debuts on the conference circuit.  Such was the case for me.  OLF is where I presented the talk “Be A Wonk” that discussed how policy and law get made and what we can do as geeks to influence these issues.</p>

<p>As promised, I’ve posted <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/presentation-files/non-academic/2009-09-26-OhioLinuxFest.odp?attredirects=0">my slides as the original OpenOffice.org format</a> and also have posted <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/presentation-files/non-academic/2009-09-26-OhioLinuxFest.pdf?attredirects=0">a PDF version of my slides</a>, which is decidedly less sexy.  To make things even easier, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pridkett/be-a-wonk">here’s a copy of the slides on SlideShare</a>.  At some point I might record some dialog to go along with the slides, but for now this is what you get.</p>

<p>In previous years I may have been a bit too critical about some of the talks at OLF, there would usually be a few periods during the day that I couldn’t find anything good to see.  I’m pleased to say that was never the case this year.  Among an awesome schedule of talks there were standout talks from <a href="http://www.silwenae.org/blog/">Paul Cutler</a> about GNOME 3.0 (GNOME Shell could be some new hotness), <a href="http://stompbox.typepad.com/">Jorge Castro</a> about how to fail at building a project, <a href="http://spot.livejournal.com/">Tom Calloway</a> about licenses for projects, and <a href="http://ubuntulinuxtipstricks.blogspot.com/">Mackenzie Morgan</a> about how to handle translating between package management.</p>

<p>The keynotes were both excellent.  <a href="http://www.brainofshawn.com/">Shawn Powers</a> did a great job of setting up the conference in the morning, despite having lost his slides on the flight in. Although there was some Microsoft bashing in his talk, there was also plenty of realistic Linux bashing, the subject of which will be a future post.  He addressed some of the failures of Linux and people selling Linux machines (GMA 500 anyone) and also encouraged us to be honest about the faults of Linux, rather than just glossing over them.  The conference closed with <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Edoug/">Doug McIlroy</a> — the man who invented Unix pipes — describing some of the problems with sophisticated software and how often we just need to approach the problem from a different aspect rather than adding in extra complexity.</p>

<p>I have to say that OLF 2009 was a smashing success and much better than previous years.  This was my fourth time attending and the conference has certainly evolved — the team that plans and runs the conference it is much more polished and organized than in years past and we’re starting to get some great PR from the conference.  There’s a solid pool of commercial sponsors along with numerous community based projects that return year after year. It’s good to see an all volunteer event thriving.</p>

<p>Going forward, there are good things in store for OLF.  OLF has already put itself in a position as one of the most gender and ethnic friendly conferences in Open Source, thanks to their commitment to get women and other minorities represented.  I’m pleased that many of the key organizers were women as were some of the great speakers.  After the main conference they also held a workshop on diversity in Open Source — which addressed many topics regarding participation in OSS, one of which is why only 2% of OSS developers are female, but nearly 50% of professional software developers are female.</p>

<p>If you can make it to Columbus on the last weekend of September 2010, I highly recommend attending OLF 2010, as I’m certain it will be another great community organized conference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> has, rightfully in most cases, alerted computer and technology users to the problem of “<a href="http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/antifeatures/">antifeatures</a>“. Briefly, an antifeature is when a program does something to offer a lesser experience that took significant effort to accomplish. Often times antifeatures are used as differentiating elements between different versions of a product. When you buy the lesser version everything is still there, it’s just that there is a small amount of code that disables part of program. Code that had to be written by a software developer and cost money to implement.</p>

<p>Common examples of antifeatures are software packages that arbitrarily the number of remote connections (e.g. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/pricing.aspx">Windows Server</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/">Apple Remote Desktop</a>) and how inexpensive digital cameras automatically process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_image_format">RAW</a> image data to JPEG — the latter is an example from the Free Software Foundation that may not hold up because of the cost in allowing a user to access the image processing pipeline in the middle, although the <a href="http://chdk.wikia.com/">CHDK</a> hackers have made good headway.</p>

<p>With the Free Software Foundation so adamantly anti-antifeature, you can imagine my surprise when I discovered <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">GNU IceCat</a>.  Not only is IceCat a duplication of effort of Debian’s <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel">IceWeasel</a> software — both are versions of <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a> that lack the registered trademark of the Firefox branding, something that requires a usage agreement (note: IceCat originated before IceWeasel and originally was named IceWeasel, however the name was ceded to Debian when the latter became more dominant and higher profile). To be fair, Mozilla has little choice in this matter. You’re legally obligated to defend a registered trademark or you can lose it — a law that is fundamentally at odds with Free software. However, what is surprising about IceCat is that rather than providing the full access to the plugin ecosystem for Firefox, IceCat has chosen to provide access to only those plugins that are also Free software.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/"><img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/firefox.png" alt="Mozilla Firefox" /></a> vs. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/"><img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/icecat.png" alt="GNU IceCat" /></a> vs. <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Iceweasel"><img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/iceweasel.png" alt="Debian IceWeasel" /></a>
        <figcaption>It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a nerd fight and no one cares! </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This is clearly an antifeature. Somewhere out there in Internetland a programmer spent time to code a feature in IceCat that restricts the ability of a user to download all the plugins for Firefox. While this is very much in line with the Free Software Foundation’s stance on having all software be Free, it’s not good from a user choice standpoint, and is clearly an antifeature that is wholly different than the primary reason for the project — avoiding trademark issues with the Firefox branding.</p>

<p>I’m not attempting to say that IceCat is a bad project — I don’t use it, but I can understand why it is there — it serves as a bit of protection should something crazy go on with the trademark agreement for Firefox. Furthermore, the Free Software Foundation is perfectly free to create a parallel plugin ecosystem, but they should be entirely clear about it — in this case Free software isn’t about choice or freedom from licensing agreements, it’s about their ideology and how they can create a tool to enforce their worldview.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It’s no secret that almost all software has bugs. Even if you are lucky enough to understand how to formally verify a program, odds are that it won’t work for your program. It’s just far too difficult. Rather than eliminate all bugs, which is next to impossible to do, software engineers have sought ways to minimize the number of bugs present in a system and ensure timely responses when bugs are discovered in the field.</p>

<p>For a software engineer this typically means a suite of test cases. Each one is a carefully constructed situation that can be programatically reproduced. When a defect is found in the system, a test case is written that exercises the defect. Before future versions of the software are released the test cases must all pass. In rare cases you’ll find a team using full-on test-driven development where test cases are written before code is written for new functionality, but the basic process is the same.</p>

<p>From the end user perspective, this usually means patches for the software. In Windows these are often delivered via Windows Update or Office Update, although a myriad of programs have other more annoying ways to tell you that they need to be upgraded. In Mac OS X there is the software update feature that checks for major updates. Within Linux there is apt, or another equivalent tool that checks for updates on almost all software on the system. Why Mac OS X and Windows only check for updates on apps provided by the OS manufacturer and not for the whole system, as Linux does, could be the subject of another whole article.</p>

<p>What happens when a bug slips through the cracks? When happens when a bug is known, has been reported, is routinely experienced by hundreds or thousands of individuals, but doesn’t get patched through these methods? The result is an exercise in frustration that will leave many users searching for a new solution.</p>

<p>I’m going to illustrate this problem with a bug that I recently encountered. The time was around 1am on the Monday morning of Labor weekend. Papers were due at 6am for a major international conference, and I was wrapping up final revisions so I could go to bed. We were using Microsoft Word 2007 to create an academic paper that had many equations present. Submissions to the conference were required to be in PDF form, for which I typically use <a href="http://www.primopdf.com/">PrimoPDF</a> in Windows, although I realize that Office 2007 has native PDF support. I clicked through to have PrimoPDF create a PDF and this is what I saw:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/missingequations.png">
        <figcaption>Those white spaces are where my equations used to be. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>That’s interesting, where did all of my equations go? I’m aware that word sometimes has strange settings that change the actual print output by removing things such as graphics, I looked at the print preview and double checked all my settings. Everything looked normal, the equations showed up in the print preview. I proceeded to try about two or three other PDF engines but had no luck in the process. It appeared that my document did not want to retain its equations.</p>

<p>I started to panic with thoughts of having to convert the paper to a different format at this late stage of the game. I googled around and found a variety of forum posts that provided suggestions. The first was simple enough, just use the native PDF support in MS Office 2007. I clicked through and I had a PDF of my document, but the quality was less than stellar, especially when on viewed on a Mac.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/badequations.png">
        <figcaption>It seems like those curves are made up straight lines, almost as though a kindergarten student cut them out of construction paper </figcaption>
    </figure>




  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/fonts.png">
        <figcaption>Windows is on the left, Mac is on the right.  Here I though that PDF was supposed to look the same everywhere! Silly me </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>The problem results from the fact that Office 2007 won’t embed all of the fonts into the PDF document, rather it will try to provide alternative options or convert the fonts to a bitmap format if it can’t. Why won’t it embed all the fonts? Concerns about licensing — basically unless Windows can verify it has a license to redistribute the font in the PDF file, it won’t embed the font and you’ll be left with something less than awesome.</p>

<p>The next suggestion was to simply save the doc as an Office 2003 document. The solution said that the equations wouldn’t be editable anymore, but that they’d still show up. That was fine as I was done with paper and just needed a one-off version to submit to the conference. Unfortunately, rather than providing something like Wikipedia, which renders the equations to a high resolution PNG file and then embeds the image in a web page, MS Office converts the equations so they’re already pre-blurred from having drank too much. Once again, this was not going to work for academic work.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/word2003.png">
        <figcaption>Can you spot the equations?  They look like they were rendered on a Hercules graphics card </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Although those two options “worked”, they were what are termed “workarounds”, and not even good workarounds, they were poor workarounds that provided decreased functionality. I work very hard to create high quality academic papers that look good, so I expect my tools to perform the tasks they advertised when I paid for them. I wasn’t going to submit something that looked amateurish.</p>

<p>Digging around some more and getting more creative with my Google query and finally stumped upon the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960985">Microsoft Support Page for my bug</a>.  Apparently, this bug only affects systems that run the combination of Microsoft Office 2007 and Windows XP. If I were to use a system with Windows Vista, I should be fine.  Great, my wife has Vista Enterprise on her Tablet PC, so I copy the document over, and attempt to create a PDF of the document.  The equations look just fine, but wait, now it’s not printing half of my images.  Ughh.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/brokenfigure.png">
        <figcaption>I swear I designed both the left and right sides of this figure </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Finally, I attempt the actual fix for Windows XP.  Apparently the problem is somehow tied up between Windows XP, Office 2007, and right-to-left language support (for languages like Thai and Arabic). The knowledge base article provides helpful instructions on how to install support for those languages.  After following the instructions you’ll get the warning:</p>

<blockquote><p>You chose to install the Arabic, Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew, Indic, Thai and Vietnamese language files. This will require 10 MB or more of available disk space. The files will be installed after you click OK or Apply on the Regional and Language Options dialog box.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh no!  10 MB of disk space?  On my 7mbit DSL line that will take almost 20 seconds to download.  Not to mention it will take up such and small portion of my 500GB drive on my laptop I’m not even going to worry about it.  But then the dreaded message pops up:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/09/windowscd.png">
        <figcaption>OMG!  Are you serious‽‽ </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Seriously, WTF? There is no option to download the patch from the Internet.  I see no way that such a small component could be considered a marketable piece of IP, as both Mac OS X and Linux have far superior support for multiple languages and there are no other operating systems that would want to steal this feature.  This left me with the realization that to fix my problem I was going to need to run around my still largely packed apartment in Minneapolis to find a CD that I hadn’t used in years. A CD to fix a bug that has been known about for a long time and is the result of strange interaction between two components, both of which have automatic update features. Did I mention it was now 2:30am?  I shudder to think of my frustration if I had been either 1) at my place in New York, knowing that the CD was in Minneapolis or 2) working on a machine without an optical drive and not in possession of an optical drive around to install the upgrade.  Of course, at that point I probably wouldn’t have worried that much, instead I’d probably download a copy of the CD off the seedier side of the intarwebs.</p>

<p>I’m using this as an example of how not to handle a bug in multiple different ways.  Firstly, the bug seems common enough that MS should have had a test case for it.  It should have been caught in the development process and feature check for the equation editor.  Equations and graphics often go together on the same page, and it’s not just Ph.D. researchers who need them, I remember using equations and graphs on the same page when using Word 6.0 for Window 3.1 to type up lab reports for my high school biochemistry class.  It’s great that MS sells a version of Office for Students and Teachers which has this wonderful bug — at least it gets them to set their software expectations low from the beginning.  Now, a test case may not have caught it before it was released, but I know that the bug has been around long enough that a test case could have been created for the numerous service packs for Office and Windows that have been released since the bug was first found.  Most glaring is the fact that the bug wasn’t even fixed with Windows Vista, it just manifests itself in a new and creative way.  Test driven development may not have caught this, but I can’t help but wonder if it’s part of the build process at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Second, reading the support document on Microsoft’s site makes it sound a little like the Office and Windows teams were left pointing fingers at each other.  The end user doesn’t care what component is broken, they just want it fixed.  They don’t care if it requires an extra 10MB of disk space. They just want their program to function as advertised.  While I’m fine with working random command lines and installing random components, most end users don’t like this at all.  This is a process that should have been fixed by a service patch for either Office 2007 or Windows XP.  Unfortunately, neither team decided it was worth their time and the end user is left to pay the price.</p>

<p>Finally, the solution of requiring the CD reminds me a little too much of 2000 (yes, I’m aware that XP is from 2000, but it still is the best OS from MS until Windows 7 is officially released in a few weeks).  Most computers have gone mobile since 2000 and many have lost the CD drive in an effort to reduce size and power consumption.  Automatic update solutions have made users comfortable with pulling updates over the Internet, so why does this still require a CD?  This is a component that has no independent commercial value and an update to Windows XP could have just as easily forced support on everyone — it eliminates a lot of those boxes you see on web pages written in right-to-left languages too — or at the very least made it a download.</p>

<p>The biggest problem that I see here is that the bug was a complicated one.  I shudder to think of the tester who was responsible for finally figuring out that it was the third component, right-to-left language support, that caused the problems. However, the solution was needlessly complicated and filled with half-solutions that caused just as many problems as they fixed. As software engineers we can do better. Integrated update systems are a nice start — within APT it is possible to say that an update to an application requires an additional update to a different application.  For example, an update to Open Office could signify that it requires an updated version of iconv — a library for translating character sets.  When you update Open Office the new version of iconv would come along with it.  See, it’s not that hard, and it’s something that Linux has been doing right since 1995.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After obtaining a new laptop one of the first things I always do is to make an image of the primary hard drive.  I then copy this image to another computer with a lot of hard disk space and leave it there as a backup should something ever go really wrong with the laptop.  There are a variety of tools both commercial and Open Source that make this process relatively easy.  The most well known tools are probably <a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/ghost">Norton Ghost</a> and <a href="http://www.acronis.com/">Acronis TrueImage</a>.  In the Open Source world there are some decent alternatives such as <a href="http://www.fogproject.org/">FOG</a> and <a href="http://www.partimage.org/">PartImage</a>.  Most of these tools have varying levels of intelligence that allow them to copy only the bits of the filesystem that are in use, dramatically reducing the amount of space that it takes to create an image.</p>

<p>However, all these solutions require me to actually obtain the software and create images will only work with that specific software. The not only results in me needed to download additional software, but also needing to hope that the software continues to be maintained in the future.  As I don&#8217;t want to be locked into a single piece of software what may not be maintained in the future, I typically do my backups with a much more simple tool, the standard unix tool dd.</p>

<p>The manual page for dd says that it &#8220;cop[ies] and converts a file&#8221;.  In this case, I take advantage of the fact that all block devices present themselves as files under Linux and simply make a copy of the hard drive using that method.  If I need to restore the image in the future, I just write the image back to the hard drive using dd.</p>

<p>Because more and more computers are shipping without CD/DVD drives, especially in the category of netbooks and ultraportables we can&#8217;t just use a Linux live CD.  In my case, I&#8217;ve used this method to back up an IBM Thinkpad x31 and a Lenovo Thinkpad x61 tablet, neither of which have optical drives.  The first step is to create a bootable USB stick with a Linux image on the disk.  You&#8217;ll use this to boot into Linux and run dd &#8211; after all, you can&#8217;t image a drive if you&#8217;re currently using it.  There are various tools to do this, but I&#8217;ve had really great luck with <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">UNetbootin</a>.  If you want to use the very simple method, you can just download the software, and it will take care of automatically downloading the CD image and coping it to the USB stick to make it bootable.  It also provides an option to take an ISO image already on your hard drive and make it bootable on the USB stick.  Because it has excellent hardware support and the install CD is also a live CD, I usually use the latest version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p>With the USB stick in hand, simply boot the computer you wish to clone from the USB drive.  Once the Linux desktop appears open up a terminal and use sudo to become root (note: some Linux images have you running root all the time).  Now you&#8217;re going to use the dd command to make an image of the primary hard disk, which in newer machines is /dev/sda (some older machines may have it as /dev/hda).  Except that we need someplace to store the image, most of the time if you&#8217;ve put a Linux CD image on a USB drive it will not be writable, so unless you&#8217;ve got another large USB storage device, you&#8217;ll need to copy it across the network to another machine.  Here&#8217;s a diagram of what we&#8217;re going to do:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2009/05/dddriveimage.png">
        <figcaption>Drive Imaging Process </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Orange is operations that will happen on the local computer, and blue is operations that will happen on the remote computer where the image will be stored.  Files generated through this process can be pretty large, so doing this over a wired network is going to work better.</p>

<p>In the first step, we use dd to read the data from the hard disk, this is then piped via a standard unix pipe to bzip2, which will compress the data.  Alternatively at this point you can use gzip if you&#8217;re worried about the CPU overhead.  This is a long process that I usually let run for a couple of hours.  From there the output of bzip2 is sent to SSH, which connects to SSH on the remote machine.  Then, as we&#8217;re still dealing with standard output, we can use cat to redirect the output to a file.  This entire operation can be done with a single command and without the need to create any intermediate files.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sda <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/stdout <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1M | bzip2 | ssh USERNAME@remotehost <span class="s2">&quot;cat - &gt; drive.img.bz2&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a few parameters which may need a bit of explanation.  With regards to dd, the if and of arguments specify the input and output file, here we use /dev/stdout to indicate that we want dd to send the output to standard output.  I also set the blocksize to 1 megabyte with the bs argument.  This is then sent to bzip2 which will compress the standard input stream and send it to standard output.  SSH then takes this information, logs onto remote computer &#8220;remotehost&#8221; as user &#8220;USERNAME&#8221;, and then uses cat to save the image to a file.  This process will not show any sort of progress as you do it.  You can get a rough idea of how much data has been processed by looking at the size of drive.img.bz2 on the remote machine.  In my experience images created this way tend to be about 1/10th the size of the drive.  Alternatively, you can work the <a href="http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml">pv</a> command into your commands to get a better estimate of progress.  To restore the drive image to the drive, you can use the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>ssh USERNAME@remotehost <span class="s2">&quot;cat drive.img.bz2&quot;</span> | bzip2 -dc | dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/stdin <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sda <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1M
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In most cases you can even use this method if you upgrade to a different disk, but you&#8217;ll need to run something like <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">gparted</a> or <a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/partitionmagic">Partition Magic</a> to update the size of the filesystem and do some small repairs on the drive after restoring the image.</p>

<p>This method doesn&#8217;t generate the smallest files possible &#8211; notably if you&#8217;re working with a disk that has already been used many times, it will not generate good compression because many of the old bits are still floating around on the disk.  More advanced solutions take into account the structure of the filesystem and just code that large segments are supposed to have no data, which can provide substantial savings.  However, for a method that is quick and works with almost every system out there, I&#8217;ve found that this works wonders, and I know that dd isn&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>
