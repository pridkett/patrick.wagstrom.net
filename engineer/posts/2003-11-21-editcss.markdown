I just stubled across a neat enhancement for [Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/).  [Edit CSS](http://editcss.mozdev.org/index.html) allows you to edit the
CSS of a web page on the fly.  It's great for when you want to see either how a
web page did something or you want to change something in your web page.  If I
still did full time web development this would be my new best friend.  You can
find more information at [http://editcss.mozdev.org/](http://editcss.mozdev.org/).
