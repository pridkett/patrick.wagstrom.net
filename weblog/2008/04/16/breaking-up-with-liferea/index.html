<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2008/04/liferea.png"></p>

<p>Dear <a href="http://liferea.sf.net/">Liferea</a>,</p>

<p>I wish I could break this to you easier.  I wish I could say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me.&#8221;  I wish I could just do the college freshman breakup and say, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re a great feed reader, you do a good job.  You&#8217;re probably the best on Linux, but I&#8217;m leaving Linux, so I can&#8217;t take you with me.&#8221;  I wish I could make this easier, but I can&#8217;t.  So, I&#8217;ll be blunt, you&#8217;re just not up to snuff anymore.  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> has made me want more out of my laptop.  I can&#8217;t settle for good enough, it needs to rock my world, and to be honest, Liferea, you&#8217;ve stopped doing that form.</p>

<p>At first I could handle your little strangesses.  The fact that I seem to get an inordinate number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Screen_of_Death#Yellow">Yellow screens of death</a> from even slightly misformatted feeds should have been a warning.  It&#8217;s the web, you&#8217;re supposed to be open to different translations, people messing things up.  You&#8217;re supposed to be flexible, but you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re stale.  You remind me of 2001.</p>

<p>As time went on, you became more picky.  Startups began to drag on.  Waking you from your slumber would sometimes take a couple of minutes before your window would even appear and let me know that you&#8217;re alive.  Even after letting me know you&#8217;re alive, you frequently went non-responsive and shunned me.  Leaving me solid colored boxes on my desktop and a warning that even though you&#8217;re ignoring me, if I try to make you go away, it could have dire consequences. Yes, it&#8217;s turned into a bad relationship.  I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t live with this cycle of dependency and rejection.  You&#8217;re getting the boot.</p>

<p>And, no, before you ask, I wasn&#8217;t seeing other feed readers before coming to this decision.  But I&#8217;ve taken some looks since then, and found that you still are probably the best around, but you&#8217;re just not right for me.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> is a great standby and mail reader that has some support for feed reading, but it&#8217;s a cruddy hack, forcing me to view the entire web page.  It completely ignoring most of the stuff in the feed, such as embedded media and tags.  It feels like I&#8217;m reading RSS feeds in some sort of bizaare love child between an email client, a web browser, and a feed reader that was genetically engineered by a committee.  It&#8217;s painful and slow. It reminds me of being back in the days when I needed to visit each web site by hand.  Sure, it probably meets some enterprise specification, and would be a great friend if I were in a locked down corporation, but I&#8217;m more open minded and free willed than that.  I can&#8217;t handle how Thunderbird wants to confine me.</p>

<p>I also looked at some old friends from before I met you. <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/straw/">Straw</a> was my first and I considered hooking up again.  Sadly, it lookes like very little has changed since I decided that that was a match that could never work.  It still is kidna slow, chunky, and sometimes likes to ignore me just like you do.  Straw feels familiar, it&#8217;s in Python so I can hack it, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to.  It should just work.  I&#8217;m not looking for high maintenance right now.</p>

<p>After I broke up with straw, I was with <a href="http://www.cmartin.tk/blam.html">Blam!</a>. It was sexy, it was fast, it was C#.  Hey, I thought that experimenting with C# was a good idea at the time, turned out it was just bad advice from a friend.  Blam! still refuses to play well with others, crashing completely on numerous feeds.  Blam! also found a way to take up more of my time and resources that you ever did. Clearly Blam! would make a poor replacement for you, Liferea.</p>

<p>Some of my friends have been telling me to try out the new bicycle in town, <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>.  Everyone is doing it, it&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s slick, and it means that I don&#8217;t need to worry about what&#8217;s on my system or do any maintenance.  Plus, it&#8217;s available everywhere and I can take it with me on a plane.  I&#8217;ve thought about, and may still visit it, but I&#8217;m worried information it keeps about me and what it will with that information.  Will she go out and let the man know that I read <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/">Al Jazeera</a> if they ask?  She also has a nasty tendency to want complete control over all of my information. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m willing to become that dependent.</p>

<p>You see, Liferea, it&#8217;s not that I have something else right now.  It&#8217;s just that I can&#8217;t be with you anymore.  I hope you can understand.  One day, we may look back on this day with fondness and conclude that it was a great relationship.  That you let me experience feeds like never before. In the mean time, I&#8217;m just going to take my OPML file and go looking for someone else.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Patrick</p>
