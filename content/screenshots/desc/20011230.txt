This is just a little shot showing my setup of Emacs 21.1 on my system.  I'm
back to redhat and it seems to have stabilized now that I've upgraded
the libraries for GLIBC that previously crashed my web browser quite often.

I'll probably be using Emacs more in the future because it's got some nice
features for editing of Lisp.
