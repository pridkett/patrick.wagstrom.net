The Great WPLUG pcHDTV Buy Part 2

A few weeks ago I posted about <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/wplugPCHDTV.xml">The Great WPLUG pcHDTV Buy</a>
and how I was I hoping to get 10 cards organized in a purchase.  Beyond my expectations, we managed to get almost 17 people to
purchase cards.  This is 17 more people who are standing up and saying that the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> must stop this lunacy with regulating content and
the <a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">broadcast flag</a>.
This is 17 more people who are exercising their rights to preserve data from the wireless spectrum that by definition belongs to
the public.
</p>
<p>
If you missed the purchase then there still is a bit of time.   You can buy the cards until June 30.  After that point, the man
puts the smack down on our fair use goodness.  If you're a member of <a href="http://wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> you can use the code WPLUG for another $5 off.
</p>
<p>
I'll be giving a talk on these issues on June 4 at the <a href="http://wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> meeting.  The first part will be
about <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> and the second part (post lunch) will be helping people to build these things.
Trust me, you want to miss it.  We're gonna have some free goodies from the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> there too.
With any luck we'll have some media folks come visit us too and get a good article in the <a href="http://post-gazette.com/">Post-Gazette</a>.
</p>
<p>
The cards should be here sometime next week.  I'll deliver them no later than the April 30 WPLUG/PghSage meeting.
