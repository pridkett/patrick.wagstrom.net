Using Mozilla in Python Programs

So rather than doing work today, I decided to write a nice little tutorial on
how to use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygtkmoz">PyGTKMoz</a>.
It is basically a mirror of Erik Dasque's <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~edasque/projects/Tutorial/glade2.html">similar C# tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
But that was only half the fun.  In true overkill style I felt that I had to
create my own XML dialect for this little project to automatically number
figures, create hyperlinks, and do all sorts of other fun stuff.  So, as
a result, there is an xml and html version.

Without further delay I present: <a href="/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.html">Creating a GNOME Web Browser with Python</a> or the <a href="/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.xml">XML version if you like</a>.
