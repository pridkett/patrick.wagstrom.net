Preliminary Technorati Tags Support

<!-- Date: 2005-03-22 09:38 -->
<p>
I've added preliminary support for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/">Technorati
tags</a> to my weblog.  The beauty of everything being all XML-ified on this weblog is
that it means this took basically 0 programatic support requirements.  A few small
changes were made to my XSLT so the tags show up on both the blog entries and on my
<a href="/weblog/index.rss">rss feed</a>.  One of the planned features for TimeSuck
is to give everything tags so it's all sucked together in one big happy family.  Thus,
clicking on a tag for "home" would bring weblog entries, photos, and links related
to that topic.  And in an ideal world, this would all be synchronized with sites
like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> and
<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.
