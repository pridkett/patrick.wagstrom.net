  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the wonderful things about the Internet is how you can easily link to
other documents that are relevant to whatever topic you&#8217;re preaching about.
However, one of the most reprehensible things is the process of hot linking to
images served off other people&#8217;s sites.  Such was the case with <a href="http://www.gnxp.com/">Gene Expression</a> while it seems to be a
moderately interesting weblog, and I&#8217;m kinda happy he linked to me, it was
done completely the wrong way.</p>

<p>Apparently many people find this whole <a href="/weblog/weblog/random/averageJoe.xml">Tareq Kabir</a> thing from &#8220;Average
Joe&#8221; a lot more interesting than I do.  So the person at GNXP.com linked
to my article, which is fine, but also linked to a picture that I had snarfed
from <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  The problem comes from the
fact that his <img> tag had the complete ref
to the image on my site.  Thus every hit on his page was generating traffic on
my page.  This is a very incosiderate thing to do as it forces other people to
pay for your bandwidth.  So off to mod_rewrite land to figure out how to block
it and here&#8217;s what you do:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://dreams.wagstrom.net:8080/.*$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^/resources/images/.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$ - [F]
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on here.  The first line says that if the
HTTP_REFERER is empty then we should ignore the
upcoming rule.  The second line says that if the
HTTP_REFERER is a URL from my site, then we&#8217;ll
ignore the upcoming rule.  The third line says that for any file that ends
with gif, jpg, or
png in my images directory, an HTTP forbidden
result will be returned.  Pretty simple and straight forward and no more
hotlinking from other sites.  If an image is ref&#8217;d from my site, it&#8217;ll pass,
if it&#8217;s entered without a referrer string (for instance from a bookmark or
something) it will pass also.</p>

<p>Another, more obnoxious alternative is to create a &#8220;No Linking&#8221; or
&#8220;Bandwidth Thief&#8221; graphic.  This is a little bit meaner and still
wastes some of your bandwidth, but can be more fun.  To do that, just change
the final rule to something like:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^/resources/images/.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$ /resources/images/bandwidthThief.png [L]
</code></pre>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2003-11-22T20:00:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 22<span>nd</span>, 2003</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been having a good time taking advantage of the Transformiix XSLT processing engine that is part of the newer
versions of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>.  However, I think I finally ran into something that it breaks
on.  Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on.  I&#8217;m dynamically generating some graphics and need to output an imagemap with them.  The
initial plan was to plunk the imagemap that I generate from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">neato or dot</a> as a chunk
of CDATA.  The problem is that transformiix ALWAYS escapes the output.  It
seems to completely ignore the <a href="http://www.zvon.org/xxl/XSLTreference/Output/xslt_text_disable-output-escaping.html">disable-output-escaping</a>
attribute.  So needless to say, this annoys me as it works fine with xsltproc.</p>

<p>My options were either have the server do the XSLT transformation or hack a way around it.  I chose the latter.  The first problem was
that the imagemaps spit out by dot and neato aren&#8217;t valid as they look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;area shape="rect" href="vendor.py?id=317" title="OpenSSH" alt="OpenSSH" coords="441,436,569,495"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now to fix that I need to add the &#8220;/&#8221; to the end of it.  So it was back to hacking the code on Graphviz (which I already had
to do for it to compile on <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a>).  Then I fixed that.  Now the problem was
I needed to make new nodes out of all these area tags.  The solution was to create another XML document in memory and transfer
the node over.  This is probably not the most efficient, but it seems to work:</p>

<pre><code>    cmap = graphviz.renderGraph(buildGraph(vendorInfo,vulns), format="cmap", engine="neato")
    cmap = """&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;\n&lt;imagemap&gt;\n%s&lt;/imagemap&gt;""" % cmap
    imageMapDoc = libxml2.parseDoc(cmap)
    mapNode = imageMapDoc.children
    mapNode.setNs(myNS)
    imageNode.addChild(mapNode)
</code></pre>

<p>Probably not the most useful out of context but I&#8217;ll sum it briefly.  So the first line makes the call that returns all of
the area tags as a string.  The next line creates a dummy XML document while the third line parses
it.  The fourth selects the <imagemap> node.  The fifth sets the right namespace and finally the
sixth dumps it back it.  Then I can process all the nodes individually using the XSLT.  It&#8217;s sweet.  If only I could have
done it the easy way with a chunk of Cdata though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember seeing swing when it came out six years ago and thinking about how
very cool it looked.  But after six years with almost no UI update it was
starting to get a little stale.  Then I was reading the <a href="http://freedesktop.org/~jg/roadmap.html">Open Source Desktop Technology Roadmap</a>
and noted what was just a little footnote at the bottom.  Apparently Java 1.4.2 supports a GTK look and feel for swing.  This is nice for me as
I already know how to do Swing and don&#8217;t want to have to learn SWT.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s especially nice when I consider that there currently isn&#8217;t a good SVG browser plugin for Firebird under Linux, so I&#8217;m probably going to need to
whip up an applet using Batik to do what I really want to do.  Should make it look a little less alien.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First up in session was Ravi Pappu from <a href="http://www.thingmagic.com/">ThingMagic</a> talking about security and
privacy in the EPC network.  The first that needs to be made is that the EPC
network is going to be some SCARY SHIT.  I don&#8217;t mean to swear, but if
Christian fundamentalists thought the UPC was the mark of the beast then EPC is
the antichrist.  Essentially everything is linked through this global network
to track down EXACTLY what product a particular EPC code relates to.  A very
good point is that the benefits of this system have yet to be clearly
articulated.  There isn&#8217;t a reason of yet of why consumers should like this
stuff.  After that he went into various threats to privacy resulting from RFID.
The most interesting of which were the constellation effect where all your RFID
tags create a shadow around you making you easy to track.  Also is the
possibility that transactions amongst individuals would be trackable.  I&#8217;d
imagine this would be the RIAA/MPAA&#8217;s dream as they could track the second hand
market and shut it down.</p>

<p>Then came what was the coolest piece of technology at the show, the blocker tag
from <a href="http://www.ari-juels.com/">Ari Juels</a> of <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/">RSA Security</a>.  Due to the way that RFID
is structured there can obviously be contention amongst devices when a reader
is present.  Basically what the blocker does is stop playing nice and always
say yes.  In this respect it says it is both a rutabega, a 12 pack of gilette
razors and a roll of toilet paper at the same.  This makes it impossible to use
readers when you&#8217;re around one of these.  However, this isn&#8217;t playing nice and
we need to respect some standards (otherwise I&#8217;d already own a cell phone
blocker and turn it on during meetings).   Thus there is the proposal to create
a privacy space in RFID.  So when you purchase a device a bit is flipped to
move the device from the normal space to the privacy space where the blocker
will block requesting it.  However, the blocker is still theoretical and has
not yet been built, leading to two problems.  First, it might not work in which
case there is need to find a new solution.  The second is that it might work in
which case it would be outlawed by the government.  Fortunately for us there is
a solution, line a bag with tinfoil and that should keep those nasty signals
out and away from the stuff in the bag.  Now the RFID chip embedded inyour
sandal is another story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This blog entry is a work in progress.  Please give me feedback.</p>

<p>November 15th, 2003 marked the first <a href="http://www.rfidprivacy.org/">RFID
Privacy workshop</a>.  It was held at the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT
Media Lab</a> and organized by Simson Garfinkel (Ph.D. student and author of
Database Nation).  Initial impressions were that it was larger than we
expected, and it appears larger than the organizers expected too.  The room for
the very important events of breakfast and lunch could hardly contain the
people.  This was the first indication that it is a hotter topic than most
people, including the organizers, thought.</p>

<p>There were two morning keynotes, from two opposite ends of the spectrum.  Mario
Rivas, executive vice president of Philips Semiconductors, gave the first talk
about some of the business aspect of RFID.  Most of this information wasn&#8217;t new
to anyone who has followed RFID.  Namely the facts that RFID can greatly
improve the efficiency of supply chains and would be a boon to any retail store
that has to occasionally do inventory.  What was a little disturbing is how he
glossed over security quite a bit.  The comment was made that they have the
best cryptologists working for them and are able to stay two steps ahead of the
bad guys, but for many in the audience with a knowledge of cryptology, this did
not calm our nerves.  I&#8217;d much rather know how the data is encrypted between
the reader and tag than to just know it is encrypted.  A final good point that
was made was the deployment of RFID devices.  Many organizations have RFID
cards that are used for entry, MIT does and so did <a href="http://www.iit.edu/">IIT</a> when I went there (both under the brand name
of &#8220;Prox&#8221; cards).  Also, many transportation agencies are deploying RFID
passes, such as the London Transport and the Chicago Transit Authority.  These
are nice for the consumer because the cards don&#8217;t expire and value can be
replaced if lost.  They&#8217;re nice for the provider because they can track
wherever you get on a train or bus.</p>

<p>Next up was Katherine Albrecht from <a href="http://www.spychips.com/">CASPIAN</a>, a consumer rights organization
that seeks more assurances about the safety and privacy of RFID devices.  A
great amount of points were discussed about how manufacturers are relying on
the complete apathy of consumers to push this technology through.  Some of the
largest threats are problems arising from hidden tags and the possibility of
data aggregation.  She also spent some time showing off some of the tags and
showing how various companies like <a href="http://www.walmart.com/">Wal-Mart</a> have been using them in tests
without telling people (this is yet another reason why you should boycott
Wal-Mart, that and they only sell crap).</p>

<p>Matt Reynolds from <a href="http://www.thingmagic.com/">ThingMagic</a> was the
next person up to talk, this was probably one of the most helpful talks and
made me happy that I spent time getting my electrical engineering degree even
though I&#8217;ll probably never use it.  For complete details, please check out his
<a href="http://www.rfidprivacy.org/papers/physicsofrfid.pdf">slides</a>.
Basically the issue is this, with a 1W transmitter you will not be able to
read any RFID chip from more than 20 meters away, the laws of physics just don&#8217;t
allow it as you&#8217;ll get too much noise over such a distance.  This is because
for 915MHz tags (the most common) the power decreases with square of distance.
For 13.56MHz it decreases with the distance to the sixth power.  Furthermore,
because we&#8217;re still sending radio waves they should be fairly easy to block by
things like metal or big bags of water salt water (humans).  Thus ramming an
RFID tag in your armpit will effectively kill it.  I&#8217;ll stress again, read the
slides, they&#8217;ll make you feel better about how RFID is not this solution
to/cause of all the worlds woes that one might think it is.</p>

<p>The initial session concluded with a panel discussion by the first three
presenters.  There wasn&#8217;t anything really new that was brought up at this
point, just some clarifications and a nice slide form Katherine that showed
the distances that various manufacturers claimed their tags could be read
from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got back from Boston around 6pm tonight.  Took a nap and then caught up on what <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> got in my absence.  For some reason the encoder doesn&#8217;t seem to be encoding at the proper bit rate anymore.  It means I loose half the space, which is a lot when you&#8217;ve got a small hard disk.</p>

<p>Anyway, the conference was great.  I learned a lot of interesting stuff and met some cool people.  I&#8217;ve got lots of notes that I&#8217;m going to be going through this week once I get caught up in my classes again.  I&#8217;ll post em to my blog in incremental sections.</p>
