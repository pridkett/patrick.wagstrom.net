I'm a proud supporter of the [EFF](http://www.eff.org/) at a level that is probably much higher than my income should support.  But in general, their work is really valuable and IÂ  appreciate all that they do.  Last year when I made my donation, I even got some nifty schwag to go with it, a nice EFF Swat Hat, as seen below.

It sat unused for well over a year, as I had a nice bucket hat that would get worn when I was outside for extended periods.  I really liked that hat.  I had owned it for about five or six years.  It was broken in.  It had history.  It fit [my enormous melon](/weblog/politics/myEnormousMelon.xml).  Unfortunately, due to the ineptitude of United/Lufthansa/Air Dolomiti in delivering my luggage to me in Genoa last month (or in Pittsburgh this month), it appears my beloved bucket hat is taking a permanent vacation in the Munich or Frankfurt airports.  Initially I thought this was not going to be a huge problem as I don't wear hats that often.  But then something different came up, baseball and tailgating with Kristina's department.  I needed a hat.  Seeing the only hat that I owned, I threw it on.

It actually was kinda cool, lots of folks asked about the EFF and I was able to tell them a little bit about what the EFF does.  Usually they just shrugged and walked off, probably thinking "this guy is a geek".  Whatever, they're chemical engineers.   Anyway, I did some examination of the tag and this is what I found:

Made where?  In China?!  Maybe this hit me on my bad side or something.  I really don't like China.  I don't like how they abuse their citizens.  I don't like how they're communist.  I don't like their cheap products.  In most cases I'm even willing to pay a decent premium to avoid buying Chinese products. Furthermore, if one [queries Dr. Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aeff.org+china) you get a lot of links the EFF's site, almost of none of them good.  China engages in draconian censorship and supression of free speech.  I can't believe that the EFF would support them like this (don't delude yourself, any piece of [cheap chinese shit](http://www.inkstain.net/fleck/archives/001654.html) you buy supports communism).

As the activist the armchair activist that I've become, I did what came natural, an email off to the EFF information address.  In the past I've gotten quick responses on issues to this address.  This was sent a few weeks ago, and I have yet to receive a response.  Even a terse message like  "we have no policy toward China." would be welcome.

    Hi,
    
    About a year ago I received an EFF "SWAT" hat as shwag for my membership
    donation to the EFF.  I really haven't worn the hat all that much, in
    fact this weekend was the first time.  I took a close look at the label
    and saw that it was made in China.  Now, I don't think that I'm some
    sort of anti-China nutcase, but I believe there is an issue with an
    organization like the EFF, that promotes freedom on the net, supporting
    products from a nation that works so hard to censor the net and keep
    controls on information.  Is China not one of the most oppressive
    regimes when it comes to information dissemination?
    
    Does the EFF have a policy about using products or goods from China?
    
    Thanks,

Maybe one of my readers with better connections will have better luck getting to the bottom of this.

**Update 2005/08/05:** Be sure to see the [followup to this article](/weblog/2005/08/effChinaHatsFollowup) including a summary of the EFF's response.  Thanks!
