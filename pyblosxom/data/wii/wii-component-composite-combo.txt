Howto Make a Wii Component/Composite Combo Cable

<!-- Date: 2006-12-08 23:25 -->
<p>
My component cable for my Wii showed up this week, and Zelda in 480p is much
nicer than 480i.  However, I've got a slight problem.  Because I use a
<a href="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-2q-49-en-15-rgbhv-70-1d2s.html">YPbPr
to VGA transcoder</a> that only handles 480p, when the Wii switches to 480i
output for things like GameCube games, I can't see it.  The simple solution is just to always switch cables,
but, that doesn't satisfy my hacker instinct and may be hard on the Wii.  Can't I just make one cable
with a switch between them?  Yes, of course I can.

Please, take a moment, go look at it, and see if you can pull off the same thing.
As always, you can break your Wii, make yourself sterile, and potentially ruin
your life with this, but that's a small price to pay for laziness.
