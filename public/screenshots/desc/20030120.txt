It's been a very long time since I had an update to my screenshots page.  I'm
back at one monitor for the time being because my <a
href="http://www.iit.edu/~cacaben/">roommate</a> is using the other one on his
computer.  I miss dual screens.  You can see bits of this new web page, mysql
command center, emacs and my desktop icons here.  I'm still running KDE and
have switched to the liquid theme.  No particular reason.  Did that a couple of
months ago anyway.
