title: Our First Christmas Tree

With marriage comes a lot of "firsts".  We're making a bit of an effort to
document some of these firsts so we can remember them for later.  On Friday,
the day after thanksgiving, Kristina and I put up our Christmas Tree.  I
purchased it last year on the day after Christmas for about $15 or so.  We've
got a whole series of photos that will eventually go up when I finish my
[photo gallery software](http://pennave.sf.net/).  But for right
now, you get to see the before and after pictures of our tree.
