Last night Kristina and I went out with a group of folks from school to the
<a href="http://www.rmuislandsports.org/">Robert Morris University Island
Sports Center</a> and hung out with the <a href="http://www.pittsburghcurlingclub.com/">Pittburgh Curling Club</a>.  It was different to say the least.  I
think every one of us fell down at least a few times.  But it was definately
fun and I think we may consider doing it again.  At the very least, at $10 a
person, it was a very cheap way to spend a Saturday evening.

Here's two of the shots I took.  Unfortunately, I realized after I left that
the light balance was off.  Also, the PowerShot A75 is not the best for getting
active shots.  Oh yeah, and my batteries died during the evening.  Hopefully
<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~phines/">Paul</a> got some better shots.
