Both of these are courtesy of <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>.
The first is that someone went and made a KILLER <a href="http://www.greyvideo.com/">video of Encore</a> from <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html">The Grey Album</a>.  Great creativity lies in this video.  Ringo starts
spinnin and John starts break dancing.  If the video goes down (waiting for
the C&amp;D's to start flying) I can probably find a site that has it an hook you
up with it.

The second is the very cool remix from <a href="http://www.kleptones.com/">The
Kleptones</a> of Queen's a Night at the Opera.  This remix is aptly titled,
<a href="http://www.kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html">A Night at The
Hip Hopera</a>.
