Any More pcHDTV Card Takers?

<p>
I think I flubbed up parts of the order on the <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/wplugPCHDTV2.xml">last order</a> of <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV cards</a>.  Namely, I ordered 1 too few, so I only get one card.
That sorta sucks.  I'm willing to order more if we can find some other folks
to join in.  I doubt we'll get as many, but we'll see.  Anyway, if you're
interested, email me.
