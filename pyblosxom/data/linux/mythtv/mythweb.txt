More MythTV Fun

I've been having some fun with <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> as of late.
 I found out that <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> now
offers HDTV in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.426597,-79.940171&amp;spn=0.022439,0.045417&amp;t=h&amp;hl=en">my neighborhood</a>, so I placed the call.  It was going to cost me
an extra $5.99 a month for HDTV, as I'd need a receiver box.  Bullocks.  Luckily,
<a href="http://brainflush.blogspot.com/">Evan</a> told me a nifty trick I
could try.  We have just the basic level of cable, costs us $14 or so a month.
Mainly we have it because it ends up saving us $1 off the cable modem bill
($56 for cable modem and basic cable, $57 for cable modem alone).  He said that
he added digital classic to his basic cable for $10 a month, and then got
standard cable with it.  Probably this is due to the use of filters on the
line and the need to remove the filters for digital.  Hmm.

<p>
Surprisingly enough, the lady on the other end of the line offered me the
digital class for another $4 a month, bringing the total to $9.99 more a month.
I asked this several times to make sure we weren't getting signed up for
something huge, and she confirmed it.  We'll see if the Evan trick works.  I
also specifically requested a DCT-6200 cable box, with firewire for my
installation, this should still allow me to use an antenna to get CBS, which
I understand is not carried on HDTV on Comcast.  No Steelers in HD sucks.

To complement this, and our upcoming deluge of programs, I realized that the
current 200GB would just not cut it.  Luckily, the folks at
<a href="http://www.fatwallet.com/">FatWallet</a> found a scorching deal on
a 200GB hard drive from <a href="http://www.outpost.com/">Outpost</a> for only
$50 after $50 rebate.  Score.  So, we should soon have 400GB of storage on
the MythTV box and HDTV, well we'll have HDTV but not on Myth because I still
can't pick up a new computer yet (for that reason, see my
<a href="/old/bible/">progress on reading the Bible</a>).  Anyway, here's to
what will hopefully be a nice upgrade.

I also go ambitious and installed Mythweb finally, no you can't see it.  But
to make people happy, I did create a virtual host where you can see what's
coming up on my MythTV box.  Be sure to check out <a href="http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/">http://mythweb.wagstrom.net/</a>
for all your useless info about my box.  If I could figure out how to make Mythweb
read only, I might make that point to my mythweb install, but not for right now.
Thank you <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_proxy.html">Apache mod_proxy</a>.
