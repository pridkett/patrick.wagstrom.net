Presentation on the Broadcast Flag Now Available

I gave another presentation this morning on the Broadcast Flag to the <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">EPP</a> tech policy group.
It wasn't my best, perhaps a bit too soft.  I should have spent more time talking about some of the economic analysis of the issues.
Anyway, the slides are <a href="/misc/20051018-epp-broadcastflag.pdf">available for download</a>.

I did find out one VERY cool thing during this talk.  Another of the students in my department has a much cooler <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>
setup than I do.  In his home country, connected to a $30/month FTTH link at a friends house he has a MythTV box set up to record television.  Then utilizing the job queue in MythTV he uploads
the programs to his local MythTV system in Pittsburgh and watches it all on XBox frontend.  Wow.  Talk about cool.  He says it takes about 2 hours to get a 1
hour MPEG stream, but still, quite cool and a very interesting use of technology.
