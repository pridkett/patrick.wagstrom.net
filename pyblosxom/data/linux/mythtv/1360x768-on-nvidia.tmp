How You Can Do Pixel Perfect Mappings with Your Widescreen LCD

Recently I purchased a <a href="http://www.sharpusa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,1798,00.html">Sharp LC32D43U 32" LCD</a>
to replace my old 20 inch monitor that was the television in our living room.  This model was selected largely because
it has a very good combination of inputs, with 3 HDMI inputs, 2 component inputs, and a VGA input for computers.  While using
the VGA connection would be pretty straight foward, using a DVI to HDMI cable should yield better output.  These cables
can usually be found for about $10-$15 if you know <a href="http://www.tendonusa.com/">where to look</a>.

In addition to higher quality video output thanks to an all digital connection, using DVI also provides better
suppport for video modes and timings on LCD panels.  Back in the bad old days, these modelines needed hand modified
in your XFree86 configuration -- now thanks to EDID and Xorg, these settings are no longer necessary.  The process
of getting your computer to display on your TV consists of just plugging the computer into the TV using the
DVI to HDMI cable.

But wait, you start up your display and see that it doesn't look perfect.  What's going on?  Most WXGA panels will
advertise only a 1280x720 resolution (720p)
