Hot damn, it looks like I might actually finish the creation of Priblog that
I've always been talking about.  While I really like the idea of working
with flat XML files, the fact of the matter is that performance matters to
me.  I hate how slow pyBlosxom becomes when it has to walk all of my entries.
The additional overhead of firing off a python process on every page hit
isn't that great either.  I'm sure I could find a way to get around that
using [mod_python](http://www.modpython.org/) or something like
that, but I think that will just raise more problems.

Instead, I've been playing with (cue [Warrant](http://www.warrantweb.net/) music here) [CherryPy](http://www.cherrypy.org/).  Basically,
CherryPy is a persistant python process that serves up web pages.  This means
that I can maintain one set of database connections, one listing of the entries,
and all that jazz.  It's terribly easy to create nice web applications with it.
Add in built-in session management, and you can see why I'm happy.

Basically the new version of Priblog works with a
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) backend.  It requires
[LibXML](http://www.libxml.org/) to generate the XML pages and
do some fun stuff with XSLT for browsers that can't handle it, like IE.
Right now, I'd estimate that I'm at about 50% of the progress that I have
in my pyBlosxom install.  I still need to add in category browsing and date
browsing, but those are the last outstanding features.  It looks like this
time I might actually finish something.  Yay.

I half feel like I'm now in a race with another guy.  Apparently there
are [others who wish to accomplish the same](http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/2005-09-11/PyBlosxom_).  I guess mine won't truly be a pyBlosxom,
because for time being you're going to need a database behind it.  Not sure
if I'll keep that idea forever or not.
