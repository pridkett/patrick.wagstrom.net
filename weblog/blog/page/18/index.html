  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m organizing a mass purchase of <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV 3000</a> HDTV tuner cards for folks in WPLUG.  The more we buy, the cheaper they go.  I&#8217;m hoping to get an order for 10 or so.  That way we get about $25 off per card!  Wowza!  Take a look at the <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/pwagstro/pchdtv.html">current sale status</a>.  If you&#8217;re interested in a few cards and are not a <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> member, email me and I&#8217;ll see what I can do for you.</p>

<p>Remember, buy them before July 1, or don&#8217;t buy them at all.  Yay for the wonderful <a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">Broadcast Flag</a>! Protect your fair use rights today!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been adding tags to all of my weblog entries recently.  I think it&#8217;s
a kinda cool thing to do.  However, if you&#8217;ve been reading my weblog, or even
just the RSS version of it, you&#8217;ll notice that the tags have been bouncing all
around.  Well, let me explain the reason for this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> has set up a system
to <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags">tag weblog entries</a>.  In this
way, when I write an entry on &#8220;linux&#8221;, people can go visit the
<a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/linux">linux</a> tag on
Technorati and see other associated folks who also wrote about Linux.
I&#8217;ve noticed that it&#8217;s added about 80 hits a day to my weblog.  Which is
pretty impressive.</p>

<p>The basic mechanism is this: somewhere in your weblog when you make a link
you include the attribute rel=&#8221;tag&#8221;
in the link element.  This can be just a general link to the Technorati tag
page or to anything else.  I&#8217;ve chosen to go the simple route and just link
to the technorati tag page, although if I ever finish time suck, it will link
to my unified tag page for my weblog, photos, bookmarks, and articles.  So
the simple way to do this is to include a span of HTML like <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/technorati" rel="tag">technorati</a>.  This puts the link there and when Technorati recrawls my page
it grabs the links.</p>

<p>Sounds all good and straight forward, but there is a catch.  Apparently there
is a flaw in the technorati spider (as confirmed by <a href="http://epeus.blogspot.com/">Kevin Marks</a> in IRC).   Basically, it&#8217;s associating my tags with
the wrong articles, which is most uncool.   This is difficult to understand as if it&#8217;s grabbing my RSS feed there is no way this should be happening because the
different tags are in different <item>
elements.  Thus, for my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/faith/wallisOnJustice.xml">previous entry where I
mentioned globalization</a>, the tag entry on Technorati takes you to <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/web/mpopKiller.xml">&#8220;A gift to
planet wplug&#8221;</a>, which is wrong.  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s also confusion people, and I&#8217;ve
gotten one email about polluting the blogspace.  I&#8217;m not sure if the spider grabs the
stuff from my web page or the RSS feed, so I&#8217;ve been trying to move articles and tags around in relation to one another.  That&#8217;s why for right now on my
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/index.rss">rss feed</a> the tags
are at the top of each entry.  I hope to move them back down at some point
in the future, but right now, I just want it to work.  So here&#8217;s hoping that
the latest sets of updates actually cause everything to work.  If not,
well I guess I keep polutting the tag space until I either get banned or
technorati fixes their site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.daeken.com/">Codi Brocious</a> has posted a <a href="http://www.daeken.com/2005/03/21/project-statement-for-pymusique/">project statement for PyMusique</a> describing in clear terms what it does and why they do it.  Of key to note is that PyMusique does NOT give you free access to <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>.  You still need to have an account and pay for the songs or redeem them with bottle caps from Pepsi. However, what they don&#8217;t do is apply the DRM because its an open source project and thus would be trivial for people to remove this capability.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, but the egg is clearly on your face on this one.  Having the client apply the DRM is just plain old DUMB. Never ever trust the client.  Yes, it&#8217;s possible to keep trying to close the holes that PyMusique uses, but eventually they&#8217;ll look just like a real client and then you&#8217;ll have real problems.  Don&#8217;t get me completely wrong, I&#8217;m not angling for Apple destruction here.  iTunes is great thing, however, DRM simply does not work.  I can&#8217;t think of a music service that hasn&#8217;t had its DRM broken, deal with it.  The RIAA and the cabal of cronies need to wake up on this issue. Until then, download for the cheap at <a href="http://www.allofmp3.com/">allofmp3.com</a>.  Yes, it&#8217;s legal in the US to use this site (as the goods technically count as being purchased in a foreign country where they were legal, or something along those lines.  Anyway, it was discussed on Dave&#8217;s IP list and that pretty much convinced me).</p>

<p>To sum it up in a nutshell, Owen Taylor, of GTK fame, has written a cracktastic GL compositing X server where everything is rendered as a GL texture, ala Mac OS X.  This allows us to do all sorts of cool stuff with the desktop, just like Mac OS X does.  Also, he shows off some of the really cool progress that is being made in integrating <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> with <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> for great vector rendering on the Linux desktop.  Go watch to videos.  Grab the <a href="http://www.theora.org/">theora</a> versions for extra goodness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.mindbending.us/">MindBending Software</a> produces nifty
products that inserts subliminal messages into games.  This is accomplished by
intercepting GL calls and layering new graphics on top of it.  They also
can perform some trippy transformations to get your zen on.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s
really expensive, most modules will run you between $700 and $1100.  Ouch.</p>

<p>In particular, take a look at some of the <a href="http://www.mindbending.us/videos.htm">videos</a> they have online.  I dunno if putting images of Jesus in
a kids game of Grand Theft Auto is really going to help them.  Interesting
technology none the less.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve added preliminary support for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/">Technorati tags</a> to my weblog.  The beauty of everything being all XML-ified on this weblog is
that it means this took basically 0 programatic support requirements.  A few small
changes were made to my XSLT so the tags show up on both the blog entries and on my
<a href="/weblog/weblog/index.rss">rss feed</a>.  One of the planned features for TimeSuck
is to give everything tags so it&#8217;s all sucked together in one big happy family.  Thus,
clicking on a tag for &#8220;home&#8221; would bring weblog entries, photos, and links related
to that topic.  And in an ideal world, this would all be synchronized with sites
like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">flickr</a> and
<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is sort of a test entry and sort of an entry to explain what I&#8217;ve been doing.
It&#8217;s a test entry because I&#8217;m not sure if the problem with spaces on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">BlogLines</a>
has been cleared up or not.  I hope it has.  If it hasn&#8217;t then I know a ghetto way to
fix it, but it involved encoding hard non-breaking spaces around hyperlinks, which is not
quite ideal.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think I&#8217;ve got everything going well enough that most of my weird markup should
handle properly.  I did uncover a strange behavior with <a href="http://www.libxml.org/">libxml</a>
that exhibits itself on <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.  Under Linux, which is what my
laptop runs, I could write an xpath expression like: //my:verbatim, and it
would handle all of the instances of that tag in the document.  However, for some reason in OpenBSD
when I was processing my:blogEntry entries I needed to expressly specify
//my:blogEntry//my:verbatim in order for the expression to grab all the
nodes I wanted.  Not the worst thing, but still moderately annoying.  It could be a result of old
libraries on my server too.  I&#8217;m not quite sure about that.</p>

<p>I also made a few more changes to my script to generate the RSS feed.  In particular, you should
notice that all of the links, even the ones that used to be relative, now work from the RSS feed.
I imagine that there is a way to it in XSLT, but it only took a few lines of python to fix these:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ctxt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">xpathEval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;//a/@href&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">res</span><span class="p">:</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="n">ctnt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">content</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">ctnt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">startswith</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">):</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="n">ctnt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;http://patrick.wagstrom.net&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">ctnt</span>
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setContent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctnt</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Basically I&#8217;m hard prepending <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/">http://patrick.wagstrom.net</a>
to any link that appears to be relative.  I&#8217;m sure at some point this will have unintended consequences.
I&#8217;ve done a similar thing for my image blocks to display those in the RSS feed, so now you can finally
see when I post images in my weblog through the feed.  Except that you might occassionaly get bandwidth
thief graphics.  As I find referers that are causing these, I&#8217;ll white list them.  I needed to install
referer checking because some folks were causing me to use massive amounts sending out pictures that were
mine with no credit given to me.  Sigh.  Yay for the interweb.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah yes, the joys of an open platform bringing innovation back to the web.  It&#8217;s
really a wonder to see all the cool extensions hackers are creating for
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=38177&amp;t=82">FireFox</a>.  A few weeks ago I installed
<a href="http://ackroyd.de/googlepreview/">Google Preview</a>, which provides
very cool tumbnails of webpages on Google.  Today, I found out about
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> which lets you add
custom scripts for different webpages.  For example,
<a href="http://www.fidelity.com/">Fidelity</a> still has some b0rkage in
their login on Firefox in Linux (it doesn&#8217;t recognize X11 as a platform so
things don&#8217;t quite work right, like research of stocks and funds).  I can go
and hack together a script and it will automagically fix the site for me.  One
could imagine some cool extensions for web based games, ala the cool old school
Trade Wars 2002 scripts for Telix.</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t just stumble upon (which is another extension, I haven&#8217;t played
with it yet though) <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a>.
It was discovered because I found <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s</a> great new script called
<a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/butler/">Butler</a>.  This little
guy hacks up the search results for Google and removes all the ads and
provides additional links to interesting sites.  Most cool.  I&#8217;m cotinually
amazed by the innovation that comes out folks hacking on FireFox.  I feel very
meek in comparasion to their geekiness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just noticed another interesting <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> problem.  Apparently
BlogLines doesn&#8217;t properly handly article updating as it should.  This means that if it fetches my
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/mythTorrent/mythTorrent.rss">mythTorrent feed</a> while a show is
recording then it will include the show twice, adding it again after the show is completed.  Mainly this
is because the entries for filesize will vary.  The solution to this is to have entries not show up until
after they are finished recording.  Shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal.  Bear with me, repairs in progress.</p>
