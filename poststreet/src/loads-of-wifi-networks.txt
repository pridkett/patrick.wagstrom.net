Loads of WiFi Networks in Network Manager

This week was what is becoming my annual pilgrimage to Santa Clara, California
for <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/">EclipseCon</a>.  Last year during
the conference I took <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/">CalTrain</a> from
Mountain View to San Francisco to have dinner with
<a href="http://www.kenneths.org/flog">Kenneth</a>.  It was there that I noted
that NetworkManager unceremoniously crashed my laptop when it was exposed
to the hundreds of networks visible on a high speed train barreling through
Valley.
</p>
<p>
This year I repeated the experiment and found that NetworkManager never crashed.
Here's a little bit of proof in the form of a screenshot that shows just a
small fraction of the number of available networks.  This was taken sometime
earlier in the trip -- there were only about 75 networks in the scroll view
at this point.  At some points there were well over 300 networks in the
scroll view.

It wasn't completely 100% yet.  There still was the tiny little issue of a very
slow and non-responsive user interface when activating NetworkManager, but it's
certainly a good start to see it can handle so many networks.  Perhaps next
year I'll try and see how it handles multiple network cards during the trip.
