Scissors is on Autopilot

<a href="http://scissors.wagstrom.net/">Scissors</a>, the fine K6-200 machine
with a badass circa 1997 "I Love Unix" SCO sticker will be on autopilot for the
next few days as I'm off in Texas, it's like a whole nother country down there.
If this is anything like previous trips, something will go wrong three hours
after I leave Pittsburgh and the server will just stay down.  Such is life.
