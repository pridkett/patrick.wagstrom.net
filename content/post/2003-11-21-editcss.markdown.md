I just stubled across a neat enhancement for
[Firebird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/).  [Edit
CSS](http://editcss.mozdev.org/index.html) allows you to edit the CSS of a web
page on the fly.  It's great for when you want to see either how a web page did
something or you want to change something in your web page.  If I still did
full time web development this would be my new best friend.  You can find more
information at [http://editcss.mozdev.org/](http://editcss.mozdev.org/).
