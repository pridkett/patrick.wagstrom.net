I think that the migration of my website to the openbsd server has been successful.  It took a lot longer than I wanted because first I had the two ethernet cards in the firewall mislabelled, then one wasn't accepting DHCP addresses.  Now it seems like everything is all cool.  I must say, [pf](http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html) is a very cool piece of software.

Anyway, there still are a few things that need to be taken care of on the system.  I don't think that all of the scripts will be updating right away.  I need to work on that stuff.  The chroot webserver that OpenBSD uses might also cause some problems, so if you see any, email me and let me know.
