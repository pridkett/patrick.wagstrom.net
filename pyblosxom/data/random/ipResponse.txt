IP Response to &quot;google helps burglers [sic]&quot;

I'm not sure if Dave is going to post my response to interesting people, but
I figured that I'd post it here.  I don't like how Googlebashing seems to be
the in thing.  I happen to like Google.  Their autolink feature of their
toolbar is an option that is not on by default, and yet people complain about
it.  The most recent one was some complaining that you could do reverse
phone numbers in Google.  The horror!  Here is my response as I sent it to
Dave.

For IP if you'd like.

Dave,

While it might be the hip thing to bash Google for this, they are not
the only web site that has this feature.  For example, a quick look
reveals that Verizon has this ability [1] as does
ReversePhoneDirectory.com [2].  A simple search on Google will reveal
many more.  So it's not just Google that "helps burglers [sic]".

What many folks should be more worried about is the growing amount of
other records online.  For example, in my house hunt in Pittsburgh, I
was able to look up large amounts of information on the various
properties through Allegheny county's property website [3].  This allows
a search not only by address, but also by name.  On each property I was
able to get information about the owners real address, the mortgage
holder, tax status, sale price, building condition, a map, and a whole
lot more.  Thus, knowing only her last name, I was able to find the
address, photos, and a floorplan of Teresa Heinz Kerry's house out in
Fox Chapel[4].

My assumption (for what it's worth) is that Google has some people
working there who are aware of the privacy implications of such a
system; they do have a way to opt out.  When small municipalities
without knowledgable privacy folks start putting this information online
we have a much greater issue.
