[BusinessWeek](http://www.businessweek.com/) has an [article](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2002/tc20020927_7367.htm) up about [Eldred vs Ashcroft](http://eldred.cc/).  On other interesting stuff, I found out that [Lawrence Lessig](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/) has a [blog](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/) on his web page.  That might be a good thing to set up a news feed for so I can see updates on my page.
