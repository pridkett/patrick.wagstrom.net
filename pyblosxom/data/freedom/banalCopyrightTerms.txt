Silly TOS on Webpages

Today <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">slashdot</a> had a link to
<a href="http://www.chuckjones.com/">Chuck Jones'</a> web page.  I visited the page and
found the following copyright notice at the bottom:

<p>
This seed a little like boilerplate text that might appear on other web sites.  A
little googling reveled that 
<a href="http://www.eireporter.com/professorjam/">Professor Jam</a> has almost the same
exact text:
</p>

I remember seeing a lot more TOSs like these back in the early days of the Internet,
back before people understood what fair use was.  Basically, you can't just say someone
agrees to something.  They need to sign away anything beyond just fair use.  For
example, at a baseball game, I don't have the normal fair use rights, but that's
because I agree to those terms when I enter the stadium (read the back of a ticket).
Albeit, even that really hasn't been challenged.  In any case, they can't take away
the right to paraphrase or to discuss in a public forum.  Silly non-Internet-literate
people.

<p><b>Updated 2004-05-30:</b> Removed some of the copyright and all rights
reserved symbols because they were UTF-8 (or something like that) and causing
the XSLT processor to die for people who use crappy browsers.
