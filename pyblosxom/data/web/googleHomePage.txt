It appears that <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> is well on it's path to complete
world domination.  Earlier this year they released the excellent <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>.
About a week ago they came out with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>.  And today I see
that they've finally come up with a suitable home page in <a href="http://www.google.com/ig">Google Personalizable Home Page</a>.
They don't have a ton of options right now, but it suits the geek market pretty nicely.  I can't wait until they
allow you to have the system automatically snarf random RSS feeds.

All this reminds me, Google still stores everything you do on their site.  That's actually really scary.
