More on Banning Link Spammers

Looking through my weblogs I saw that I also was getting a lot of hits from
<a href="http://visualintensity.com/adminshop-com" tile="find out the truth about xopy">http://www.xopy.com/friendslinks.php</a>, at first I thought it was
a nifty site like <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="Cool social bookmarking
site">del.icio.us</a> that allowed you to see friends links.  It turns out
that they're part of a group called <a href="http://visualintensity.com/adminshop-com/">AdminShop</a>, and they're basically doing link spamming.  So I needed
to add them to my block list.

Now this seems to cut down on most of my link spamming.  However, it still
isn't ideal.  I guess in an ideal world I'd set up small little CGI that I'd
force them to.  Once they hit they CGI they'd get their IP address logged and
immediately sent to pf for banning of the client.  I suppose I could whip
something like that up pretty easily, but I don't have time right now.  And
no, that doesn't mean it will be done by tonight, I've got plenty of other stuff
to do before then.

Also, I switched many of my redirects from 302 (temporary) to 301 (permanent)
yesterday, however <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">BlogLines</a> doesn't
seem to have taken the hint.  Any ideas on how you can force BlogLines to
recognize a 301 and update its database if its repeatedly received?  Also,
I'm wondering why the request from BlogLines don't include the <a
href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers" title="Conditional Get for RSS Hackers">If-modified-since or the If-none-match headers</a>?  If they did it would save them bandwidth and
the hassle of having to parse thousands of feeds that aren't updated on a
daily basis.
