More updates to the page

So with finals comes another great time of the year.  The time when I look
at my web page and try to fix things that are broken.  Most recently I've
been waging a war over 404 pages.  Most of these pages actually exist
but were not moved into the new layout of the website.  For the time being
all of this is being fixed via directives in my <my:verbatim>httpd.conf</my:verbatim> file and <my:verbatim>mod_rewrite</my:verbatim>.  If you stumble
across any, send me an email and let me know.
