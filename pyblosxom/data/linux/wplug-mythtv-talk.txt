Slides from WPLUG MythTV Talk
<!-- Date: 2007-10-20 17:28 -->

<p>
Today I gave a talk to <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> on 
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  I think it ended up
going pretty well and it was quite well attended.  Most people seemed
interested in seeing what they could do with scavenging some computers
and trying to get started with MythTV on the cheap.  That's pretty
easy if you just want to go standard def: pick up a WinTV PVR-150 card
and you'll be on your way.  If you want to go high def, you'll need a
bit faster of a processor, the kind that most people may need to
purchase a new system for.

On of the things that I think was really helpful was a set of slides I
put together on questions to ask yourself before building a MythTV
box.  In hopes that this helps some other folks, I've <a
href="/misc/20071020-WPLUG-MythTV.pdf">posted the entire set of slides
here</a>.  Unfortunately, most of the talk was demonstrating MythTV to
everyone, so you'll lose some context there.  I'll try to answer
questions if possible.
