The Bean

As most of my readers know, before migrating to Pittsburgh, I lived in Chicago for
six years.  It's a great city to live in and their parks are wonderful.  While in
Chicago, I paid my share of city taxes.  I'm sure some of my money went to help
build Millenium Park, which was supposed to be open in 2000, but didn't open up
until 2004.  I got a chance to see it in November when I was in town for CSCW.

Well, it turns out, it's illegal for me to photograph "The Bean", even though my
tax dollars paid for it and it's in a public space.  You can read all about it
how <a href="http://newurbanist.blogspot.com/2005/01/copyrighting-of-public-space.html">The
Bean is copyrighted Public Space</a>.  To this I say "FUCK YOU Anish Kapoor".  I do
not believe it can be copyrighted.  Here's some of my pictures of the bean.  If you'd
like the 3.2 megapixel ones let me know.
