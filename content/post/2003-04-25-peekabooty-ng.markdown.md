Well, for those of you not in the know, I've been working on an updated version
of [Peekabooty](http://www.peek-a-booty.org/).  This one is written entirely in
[Python](http://www.python.org/) because it makes development a lot easier.
Right now it's not fully working yet, but a lot of the components have been
laid down to make it a much better architecture. Most importantly, the new
system is fully multithreaded.  This makes it a whole lot nicer than the old
verison.  Still some bells and whistles that need to be cleaned up, but other
than that, it's all good.
