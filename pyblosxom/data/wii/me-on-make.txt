I'm on the Make Blog!

One of the blogs I frequently read is the <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">Make: Magazine</a> blog.
Today I noticed when reading it that one of the topics was
<a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2006/12/how_to_nintendo.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">How
to make a combination composite/component cable for the Wii</a>.  "Wow," I thought, "someone
else had the same idea as me!".  Looking at the first picture, I was like,
"This looks really familiar."  Well, if it looked familiar, that's because it
was my writeup.  Yay.  I made it into Make's blog.  I feel special.  Thanks
for your support.
