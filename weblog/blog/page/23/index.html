  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s almost time to end my love affair with
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> products.  I&#8217;ve more or less used
RedHat as my exclusive version of Linux for the last seven years.  I had a
brief (as in three week) foray with <a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">Mandrake</a> and about a six month detention with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as my main operating systems before.  I dumped Mandrake because, well
it sucks.  Any real Linux user will tell you that Mandrake is only one step
above Linspire.  I stopped using Debian back in early 2001 because I was tired
of the snails pace of development and I wanted to be able to use some real
software on my computer.</p>

<p>In general I&#8217;ve been happy with Red Hat products.  I&#8217;ve been known to defend
them on many occassions.  I&#8217;ve found that for me they&#8217;re the right balance of
up to date software and ease of use.  Not to mention, it&#8217;s no problem finding
other people who use the software.  However, when Red Hat killed the desktop
version and starting focusing solely on the enterprise version, things started
to go bad.  I initially switched to Fedora Core 1 when it came out last year.
In general, I was pretty happy with it, but it was lacking a lot of the neato
stuff that I really wanted, for example, Mplayer.  But it was good enough, it
had GNOME 2.4, which was the newest at the time.  It allowed me to use
<a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org/">RhythmBox</a> with no difficulty.
Initially, life was good.</p>

<p>However, as time went on, I found myself using a huge variety of other APT
repositories to satisfy my software needs.  My system became a kludge to say
the absolute least.  I knew that I&#8217;d never be able to do a clean upgrade again.
Now, it comes to the point where I need to do a clean upgrade.  I&#8217;m getting
frustrated that my development environment lags so badly.  I&#8217;d really like
to try out <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a> and to
upgrade my version of <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/devhelp/">DevHelp</a> but I cannot.  Beagle just requires too much new stuff (Evolution Sharp?!)
and DevHelp needs the 2.4 series of <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a>.  I
went and compiled the 2.4 series this evening, and it seemed to work fine for
the compile, but when I installed it, all my old GTK apps died.  Things were
not happy in Whoville.</p>

<p>So here is my radical concept.  Switch distributions.  I&#8217;ve been very happy
up to this point with <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> on my
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> box.  They&#8217;ve got the mad community
support of <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, with the release
schedule of <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora</a> and the up-to-date
software of <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.  However, my window
is running short.  They&#8217;ve got a release candidate out right now, but I&#8217;d rather
have the complete thing which should be out soon.  Once that shows up I should
be happy.  At that point I can back up my files and upgrade.  Maybe next weekend
if the release comes out before then.  It needs to be one of these next two
weekends to give me a chance to clean up before I leave for CSCW.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been looking for a simple command line tool that allows some manipulation
of XML files.  Basically, what I need is a little program that allows me to
print out some nodes, delete others, replace some more, and in general, have
a good old time mangling XML files.  The main reason is because one of the tools
we use in our labs requires the use of a XML configuration file.  If I want
to run in a batch mode, I need a tool that lets me vary parameters easily and
rerun the program with the changed parameters.</p>

<p>Enter xmlsnipe!</p>

<p>xmlsnipe is a little program that I&#8217;m writing that is a little like a sed clone
for XML files.  You may ask, why shouldn&#8217;t I just use SED, well, the answer is
because that just wouldn&#8217;t be right.  Also, I needed to sharpen up my coding
skills.  That being said, while it would be easy to write xmlsnipe in something
that has support for XML, like Python, C#, or Java, I wanted to make it more
difficult to write, and more primal.  I&#8217;m writing it in C.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got it going okay so far.  It&#8217;s already automakeized and what not.  I must
say that <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/">pkgconfig</a>
makes this much easier.  Anyway, right now it can just delete and print nodes.
I&#8217;m in the process of making it able to change values of nodes.  Which is what
I really needed it to do.  Once that happens I&#8217;ll probably make a sourceforge
page for the project and put a small release up on my
<a href="/weblog/projects/">projects</a> page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>CNN is running an <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/10/13/peter.pan/index.html">interesting article</a> about how Disney is getting sued for
copyright violation.  At stake is the royalties to the Peter Pan prequel
&#8220;Peter and the Starcatchers&#8221;.  The basic premise of the lawsuit is this, Great
Ormond Street Hospital in England was given the copyright, and thus the
royalties, to Peter Pan in 1929 by the author J.M. Barrie.  Barrie then died
in 1937, meaning that under US law his work is protected until 2023.  At least
so the hospital claims.  Disney meanwhile says that the copyright expried
prior to 1998, the last time they savaged the public domain.</p>

<p>The difference is this.   1929+75 years = 2004, which why Disney says that
Peter Pan is now public domain.  However, with the Sonny Bono act, it&#8217;s now
lifetime of author + 75 years, which puts it significantly later.  Did Disney
shoot themselves in the foot with this one?</p>

<p>The thing that makes Disney really suck is that once again they&#8217;re raping the
public domain and trying to force other works into the public domain, while
not allowing their work to ever enter.  I have to wonder if the Disney lawyers
have done a benefit-cost analysis on this whole issue.  The amount of money
they&#8217;re making from ancient Mickey Mouse stuff has got to be minimal.  In any
case, at the rate that Disney bribes idiot lawmakers, there won&#8217;t be any
real public domain left in a few years and they&#8217;ll go bankrupt.  I mean, it&#8217;s
not like many of their <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0230011/">new</a> <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0299172/">ventures</a> have exactly been successful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I needed more reason to switch and finish coding PriBlog, I found out today
that the reason why some people can&#8217;t see the images that I post is because I
styleize them with XSLT.  This causes an issue becuase the entries are not
styleized before encoding them in the RSS feed.  The result is that the RSS feed
which is supposed to contain HTML, contains raw XML.  This is probably a mistake
on my part, but it&#8217;s frickin annoying none the less.</p>

<p>To make things worse, PyBlosxom seems to think that everything needs to end
in .html, which is not the case in my world.  Sigh.  Time to get coding this
weekend and get something preliminary going.  I&#8217;m not looking foward to fumbling
around with the various Atom standards.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kristina and I were awoken at 4am on Wednesday morning to quite a ruckus outside
of our humble abode.  At first we thought that our neighbors were drunk and
making noise again, after all, they seem to enjoy doing that around 3am in the
morning, so why not 4am?  Then we heard sirens, and Kristina realized that the
ruckus was on both sides of our house.  Peeking outside, we saw lots of
fire trucks and smoke.  <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/trogdor.html">Trogdor, the Burninator</a> had come to visit Lawrenceville.</p>

<p>This is where we might need a diagram to explain stuff.  So here is a quick
explanation of where we live:</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/resources/images/blog/trogdorMap.png" alt="Map of Neighborhood" /></p>

<p>Map of Trogdor&#8217;s Rampage</p>

<p>What we didn&#8217;t realize at the time was whether or not our set of row houses
was connected to the victim of Trogdor&#8217;s wrath.  We couldn&#8217;t get close enough
to tell and the firemen kept yelling at me when I crossed the street to see
bit better.  I&#8217;m still confused why they told us to stay on the side WITH
the fire.  Anyway, realizing that there was nothing we could and that there
was already four trucks on the scene, we tried to go back to bed.
Unfortunately, this house had a wooden deck so the firemen were using chainsaws to tear it down to prevent it from becoming tinder.  So it took a while
to get back to sleep.  Oh yeah, that and the fear of the fire that was 100
feet away spreading and killing us in our sleep.</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a couple of pictures of the damage this morning as I walked
past the remnants of the house on the way to the bus.  They don&#8217;t really
do it justice for the complete loss of the insides.  Everything inside the
house is burninated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I&#8217;m talking about cool and interesting applications, I shouldn&#8217;t forget
to mention <a href="http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a>, a
nifty little note taking application that automagically links your notes
together as you go.  Very cool.  Support is in the works for allowing you
to annotate your desktop objects using Tomboy.  I can definately see this as
something that will make its way into the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME
desktop</a> very fast.  Also, you can search your notes using <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a>.  All this technology is mad cool.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I discovered <a href="http://www.fellowship911.com/">Fellowship 9/11</a> today.
It&#8217;s humorous, especially if you tend to think that Michael Moore may be full
of poo.  Also, whats really cool that <a href="http://mplayerplug-in.sourceforge.net/">mplayerplug-in</a> lets it play just fine in Linux.  Yay for video
and stuff.  Also, and upgraded version of a <a href="http://www.real.com/linux/">Real Player for Linux</a> seems to handle it fine.  I suggest going for the
QuickTime stream as Mplayerplug-in lets you save it for later.  Like bubble
gum on the bedpost overnight.</p>

<p>Also, this post further highlights my problems with needed a better blogging
system than Pyblosxom.  I&#8217;m sure there have been other MLP like posts in my
blog, but I don&#8217;t remember where I put them and couldn&#8217;t decided where to
put this, so I just made a new category.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s neato hack is <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~sandino/gnomevfs-mount/index.html">Gnome VFS Mount</a>.  This little guy lets you mount Gnome VFS
directories (such as ssh://username@host/home/username) via the Gnome VFS right
into the Linux tree.  Quite a neat hack indeed.  It&#8217;s also cool because it
uses Gnome Keyring to avoid asking for a password multiple times.</p>

<p>While this probably has little direct practical use (it still needs lots of
work on caching and what not first), it provides an interesting proof of
concept of what can be possible when everything is a file and you open up the
interfaces to all people.  Maybe one of these days I should get around to
finishing writing my MythTV VFS system, which was a little thing I started
to play with when I was hacking on the auto bittorrent stuff for
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  It was all pythonified, so
probably not the best solution, but still interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to start working on Priblog again.  Basically I&#8217;m getting sick of how utterly slow Pyblosxom becomes under load.  I still like Pyblosxom more than I like solutions such as MovableType or WordPress.  But it&#8217;s not optimal when you&#8217;re running your server on a 200MHz K6.</p>

<p>So with Priblog what I&#8217;m doing is a compromise.  It still is all based on text files sitting on the hard disk, but each file is an XML file.  I&#8217;ll eventually write a simple converter or something like that too.  Anyway, the major difference is that Priblog will cache most entries as files.  This means that instead of having entires magically appear after entering them, you&#8217;ll need to run a little script to regenerate some files.</p>

<p>Hitting most of the pages will still be a CGI type interaction, as it doesn&#8217;t warrant storing all the possible combinations of files.  However, notably the RSS file will now be cached.  This is a HUGE improvement over the current PyBlosxom setup which needs to crawl the directory tree in order to find the files to make the RSS.  It&#8217;s one of the major reasons why my RSS feed is so slow.</p>

<p>Another thing I&#8217;ve wanted is the ability to put an entry in multiple categories. It seems like I&#8217;ll be able to do that with little work.  A change from my original idea is thta Priblog no longer requires <a href="/weblog/weblog/code/pridb">pridb</a> as a database.  This should free up resources on low end computers.  We&#8217;ll see how much hacking I get done on this. Hopefully airport time later this week will prove useful to me.</p>
