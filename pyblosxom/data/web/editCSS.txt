EditCSS for Firebird

I just stubled across a neat enhancement for <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firebird/">Firebird</a>.  <a
href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/index.html">Edit CSS</a> allows you to edit the
CSS of a web page on the fly.  It's great for when you want to see either how a
web page did something or you want to change something in your web page.  If I
still did full time web development this would be my new best friend.  You can
find more information at <a
href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/">http://editcss.mozdev.org/</a>.
