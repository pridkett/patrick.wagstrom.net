In addition to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), there is also
a nifty site called [nutr.itio.us](http://nutr.itio.us/) that
automagically manages all of your tag names and gives suggestions for tags that
other people have used when visiting a site.  Furthermore, links are colored
by their relative popularity for that site.  Pretty damn cool.






Also there is a very cool [Delicious](http://delicious.mozdev.org/)
extension for [Firefox](http://getfirefox.com/).  You can see it in
action below.  This makes it so much easier to manage my bookmarks than the
crappy hierarchical thing that I had been doing.  Yay for good software.
