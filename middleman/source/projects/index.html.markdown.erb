GitMiner
--------

GitMiner is a tool that crawls all of the data avaialble from the
[GitHub public API][ghapi] to build a complete picture of the contents
of a set of projects. It was originally developed for a joint research
project with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, and has since been
expanded dramatically. As of August 2013 more than 20 academic
institutions from around the world had used GitMiner as part of their
academic research program.

GitMiner is an open source project released under the Apache License
and can be obtained through the [GitMiner project page at
GitHub][gitminer]

gitminer-data-rails
-------------------

Scraping data for GitMiner can be quite difficult and time
consuming. In order to make the process easier for new researchers I
worked with Anita Sarma and Corey Jergensen at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln to download data for over 1100 different projects
related to [Ruby on Rails][rails].

This is an open source dataset distributed as a [neo4j
database][neo4j]. It is released under the Apache License and can be
obtained through the [gitminer-data-rails project page at
GitHub][gitminer-data-rails].

online taxonomy tool
--------------------

A collaborative tool designed to allow multiple peopel to evaluate the
differing social dimensions of online communities. Published as a
poster at CSCW 2011 in Hangzhou, China. See [our paper on the tool for
more information][taxonomypaper]

cvsminer
--------

A collection of tools and scripts used to analyze large open source
communities. This package was a critical part of my Ph.D. thesis
research where it was used to study the ecosystems around Eclipse,
GNOME, and a handful of smaller ecosystems.

You can find the [complete source code on GitHub][cvsminer]. In
addition I've made a large dataset of the community freely
available. See my page on [GNOME Research][gnomeresearch] for more information.

Personal Projects
=================

dc2uddf
-------

A fairly simple tool that connects to any dive computer supported by
[libdivecomputer][libdivecomputer] and exports the collection of dives
as a [UDDF file][uddf]. This was originally designed because I use a
Mac as my day to day computer, but unfortunately, my dive computer
connects via IrDA, which is not supported on Macs. Using this tool I
can download the dives through a Linux virtual machine and then import
the dives into [MacDive][macdive].

I wrote a fairly long [blog entry about the creation of dc2uddf][dc2uddfblog] that
describes the challenges with the solution which provides additional
background information.

dc2udff is an open source project released under the Apache License
and can be obtained through the [dc2uddf project page at
GitHub][dc2uddf].
