Today I figured out how to get LaTeX to generate PDFs that work for full screen display with nice big letters so I can easily make presentation slides.  That first part took the use of FoilTeX which is a not-so-free package of LaTeX macros from IBM designed to make slides.  I had the second epiphany when I downloaded and installed [PPower4](http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/support/ppower4/index.html) which allows me to add in transitions and background colors to my LaTeX.  So now I'm working on my presentation for Friday, and not a single bit of it will be generated with Microsoft stuff.  And it will truly be cross platform.  YAY.
