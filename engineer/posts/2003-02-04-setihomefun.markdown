I went a redid my little [seti@home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) script to take data off the XML version of the pages.  Also, it dumps the data into the [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database now too.  You can see more information about how I'm doing in SETI, along with my brothers, at [http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/seti.php](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/seti.php).
