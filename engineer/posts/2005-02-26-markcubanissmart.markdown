[Mark Cuban](http://www.blogmaverick.com/) takes a lot of
crap from people for being a little out there.  He reminds me a bit of
Howard Dean, he's doing things to shake people up and get them off their
comfortable asses.  He's not only the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, but
also is a major player in the migration to HDTV.  Last week he wrote
a great article about why FCC should [call the broadcater's bluff](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000893032857).

To sum it up, HDTV is out of the bag.  It's big business.  The content
producers will not stop broadcasting in HDTV if they don't get their crappy
little flag.  The flag is anti-consumer, and Mark is proud to say that his
production companies aren't going to use it.  So the flag is of great
value for him, not because it will protect his content, he's smart enough to
realize that you can't, but because his stuff won't use it and it will make
the consumers happy.  Cheers for him.
