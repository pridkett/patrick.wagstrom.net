My Brother's Work

So this entry has nothing to do with me really.  I just thought that I'd share
a link to a <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/04/10/15/1735207.shtml?tid=198&amp;tid=137">slashdot article</a> about a hard drive my brother <a href="http://peter.wagstrom.net/">Peter</a> worked on for Seagate.  Here is a little picture
to see this nice little 2.5 inch SCSI drive.
