Farewell to You Minivan

Well, the van is dead.  It proved to be a good vehicle and had a good life.
In the end it just couldn't keep up, and in the words of my Dad, I was supposed
to "shoot it and put it out of it's misery".  With $500 of engine repair and
$1300 or tranny repair and more costs to get it licensed in Pennsylvania,
I had to give up.  It had a lived a nice good life.

I decided to take a few pictures of the vehicle to give me something to
remember it by.  In the end, it was good vehicle, lasted me for a little over
four years, during which time I put about 60,000 miles on it.  It was able
to get me here to Pittsburgh, and was able to get Kristina and I to and from
Texas for the wedding and all.  Here are some pictures of it as it was being
taken away.

In related news, we're going to go looking for a new car next weekend.  No word
on whether or not we're going to buy one or not.  If anyone knows of any good
dealers in Pittsburgh (or has references about the dealers on Liberty ave),
let us know.  Unfortunately, we're basically confined to the Liberty avenue
dealers as they're the only ones withing walking distance.
