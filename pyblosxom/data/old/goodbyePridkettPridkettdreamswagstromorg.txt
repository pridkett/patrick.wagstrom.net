I'm a little sad.  <a href="http://www.he.net/">Hurricane Electric</a> had to filter IRC traffic over their <a href="http://www.tunnelbroker.net/">TunnelBroker</a> IPv6 service.  Apparently some people were doing dos attacks with it.  That makes me sad, I enjoyed it because I could set my own reverse DNS. I still can for IPv6, but I just can't use IRC through IPv6 anymore.
