Information Overload

<p>
I seem to have a lot of documentation on my computer.  This comes in the form of text files, man and info pages, HTML files, a few word docs, some powerpoint slides, and a bunch of PDF documents.  The problem is that while each of these has their own searching mechanism, there isn't one consistent mechanism for all of them.  For example say I wanted to search for "references in python" I would like to search all of the stuff including my python docs and pdf files that I have on python to try and find this.  Intuitively this doesn't seem all that hard.  Maybe I'm just fooling myself here.  Does anyone know of a piece of software that can do this?  It doesn't need to have a web frontend, any frontend will do just fine.
