  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is my first new post written in markdown for the static version
of
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog">patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog</a>. The
only reason I was running both PHP and MySQL on my server was to host
wordpress which became a pain in the ass with all of the
upgrades. This eliminates all of those nasty security holes and allows
me to focus a little bit more on just writing. Which is what a weblog
is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m running <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is a blogging
framework based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The downside to
this is that means that it cannot accomodate dynamic elements,
therefore all comments need to be farmed off to an external
service. Fortunately, I was already using
<a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a>. With only a very small
amount of work I was able to migrate everything over to the new
system. Perhaps most substantial is that I had to write a patch to
Octopress to support IntenseDebate. I&#8217;ve since created a
<a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/557">pull request for IntenseDebate support</a>
on Github. Hopefully the authors will see fit to pull it in.</p>

<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s a little more work now that I don&#8217;t have a web interface
to do things like manage images and remember my links, but I can write
posts from any text editor, which is VERY handy for when I&#8217;m stuck in
airplanes and too cheap to pay for WiFi.</p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m not certain if this is a good idea. In the past I&#8217;ve
extolled various reasons why
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2008/12/10/youre-too-smart-to-do-it-yourself/">you shouldn&#8217;t try to do it yourself</a>. However
there is also merit to doing it yourself. Up until this point I&#8217;ve
been an active Ruby Hater, and it&#8217;s becoming clear that I should at
least be peripherally aware of what Ruby can do. Although my
extensions to this point have not involved hacking Ruby, it might at
some point in the future.</p>

<p>So, for now, enjoy the fact that every post is showing up again in
your RSS reader and marvel at the beautiful new theme. With no more
worries about annoying security faults and a faster response time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past couple of days I have twice received an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577171531838421366.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read">opinion piece from the Wall Street Journal which suggests that the models used for estimating climate change are grossly pessimistic and that we really need not be concerned with anthropogenic climate change</a>. It was signed by sixteen scientists and engineers. The problem is that almost none of these people are climatologists - which is the field they are claiming is producing invalid science. Anyone can call themselves a scientist - having a Ph.D. helps - but, just because you are a scientist does not mean that you can speak authoritatively on all issues related to science. Stephen Hawking is a brilliant scientist, but he studies astrophysics, not climatology. I trust him on a lot of things, but I wouldn&#8217;t trust him on climate change. Nor would I trust Albert Einstein, Louis Pastuer, Marie Curie, or Isaac Newton on issues of climate change.</p>

<p>So, who are these climate change deniers that have the right frothing at the mouth again? Let&#8217;s take a quick look.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_All%C3%A8gre">Claude Allegre</a>, former director of the Institute for the Study of the Earth, University of Paris</strong> - Is a geochemist, which might make him qualified. It&#8217;s hard to tell as he has spent most of his time doing political work recently. He appears to have a strong contrarian streak, such as in 1996 when he insisted that asbestos was harmless and that anger over it was caused by mass hysteria. That last time I checked the link between asbestos and mesothelioma was pretty firm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Scott_Armstrong">J. Scott Armstrong</a>, cofounder of the Journal of Forecasting and the International Journal of Forecasting</strong> - This one gave me a decent chuckle. At first I thought he was a climate forecasting scientist, nope. Armstrong&#8217;s expertise is in marketing style forecasting, as in trends. His journal is also published by Elsevier. I think I threw up a little in my mouth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/JanBreslow/">Jan Breslow</a>, head of the Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics and Metabolism, Rockefeller University</strong> - A medical doctor and not a climatologist. Breslow is perhaps most well known for his work on heart disease. This is great work he has done, but it&#8217;s not atmospheric science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.marshall.org/experts.php?id=252">Roger Cohen</a>, fellow, American Physical Society</strong> - It&#8217;s difficult to find information on Cohen. Prior to retirement he worked for ExxonMobil research, but that&#8217;s about all I can find. I can&#8217;t seem to find any publications on any issue. However, he does have a very common name, making him hard to google. He frequently consort with William Happer, who appears later in the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_E._David_Jr.">Edward David</a>, member, National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences</strong> - As a member of the National Academy of Engineering I have great respect for Dr. David. However, he is an electrical engineer and has been largely retired from research for more than 20 years. Did I mention he was director of research at Exxon from 1977-1985?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Happer">William Happer</a>, professor of physics, Princeton</strong> - Seems to have moved away from research as he&#8217;s advanced in his career. During his prime he was a leader in the field of spectroscopy. Which, in case you didn&#8217;t know, has nothing to do with climate change. During his 2009 testimony to congress he indicated that an increase in CO2 is good for the planet because it&#8217;s good for plants. Yes, very much like the Competitive Enterprise Institute&#8217;s &#8220;CO2, We Call it Life&#8221; vieo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/mjk1.html">Michael Kelly</a>, professor of technology, University of Cambridge, U.K.</strong> - Kelly primarily works on semi-conductors, specifically SRAM. He is not a climatologist or even a chemical engineer or chemist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=William_Kininmonth">William Kininmonth</a>, former head of climate research at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology</strong> - Kininmonth is, perhaps, a meteorologist, although there is little information easily available about his activities. It is known that he is not a prominent researcher in any field and his &#8220;Australasian Climate Research Institute&#8221; is run out of his home and appears to be only his own writings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a>, professor of atmospheric sciences, MIT</strong> - Lindzen is perhaps the most qualified individual on this list. He is well known for his skepticism of anthropogenic climate change. He stands out from the other signatories because he can speak with true scientific authority on the issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.mii.vt.edu/MACR/faculty/mcgrath.html">James McGrath</a>, professor of chemistry, Virginia Technical University</strong> - McGrath studies polymers and fuel cells. He is a scientist, but not a climate scientist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/about/bio/nichols.html">Rodney Nichols</a>, former president and CEO of the New York Academy of Sciences</strong> - This one took me a while longer to find out information about. I believe that Dr. Nichols is a physicist from Harvard, which means he could be a climatologist. However, looking at his publication record for the last 40 years you&#8217;ll find that most of his work is dealing with science and technology policy &#8211; issues that are close to my heart. However, this doesn&#8217;t qualify him as a climatologist. I&#8217;m sure he is well learned in a variety of topics, but I don&#8217;t believe he has a deep knowledge of the current research on climatology.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Rutan">Burt Rutan</a>, aerospace engineer, designer of Voyager and SpaceShipOne</strong> - I have great respect for Burt Rutan and his creations. He has done a huge amount to make space accessible for all. However, he&#8217;s an aerospace engineer, a field which studies the design of aircraft, not the atmosphere or climate science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt">Harrison H. Schmitt</a>, Apollo 17 astronaut and former U.S. senator</strong> - As an astronaut Harrison Schmitt was on the mission that took the famous &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble">Blue Marble</a>&#8221; picture of the earth. In fact, evidence indicates that Schmitt most likely took the photo that has been credited with being a critical catalyst for the environment movement in the 1970&#8217;s. Outside of his astronaut career he was a university professor, geologist, and senator from New Mexico. None of these are related to the atmosphere or climate science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Shaviv">Nir Shaviv</a>, professor of astrophysics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem</strong> - Shaviv is primarily an astrophysicst known for his work on cosmic rays and luminosity. He has his own theory of global warming which says that the cosmic rays of the sun are responsible for global warming. His theory has not been widely accepted and has faced great challenges because of the fact that the solar output has been decreasing since the mid 1980&#8217;s.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Tennekes">Henk Tennekes</a>, former director, Royal Dutch Meteorological Service</strong> - Also a professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Penn State, Tennekes is most well known for his work on turbulence in airflows. In fact, he literally wrote the book on it. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not a book on climate change. He was reportedly ousted from the Royal Dutch Meteorologic Service for his denial of climate change and his sometimes reliance on biblical texts for justification. Look, I&#8217;m a Christian and a scientist, but I realize that I can&#8217;t use biblical texts to justify my work, that&#8217;s not how science works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Zichichi">Antonio Zichichi</a>, president of the World Federation of Scientists, Geneva</strong> - Primarily a sub-nuclear physicist who has worked at labs like CERN and FermiLab. His title of President of the World Federation of Scientists is self bestowed as he is the founder. It should not be considered to be an analog to the Federation of American Scientists. He is a highly cited researcher, and has done significant work in popularizing science in Italy, but he is not a climatologist.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Out of the sixteen people listed I count one atmospheric scientist, Lindzen, and a half, Allegre. In any community of scientists you&#8217;ll have dissenters. The fact that they could round up only one and a half climate scientists for this letter should show you just how strong the case for global warming really is. Want more evidence? 255 scientists, all members of the National Academy of Science, including 11 Nobel laureates wrote a scathing response, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/689.full">rejected by the Wall Street Journal and later published in Science</a>.</p>

<p>Are you one of the best software engineering students in the world? Do you dig mining software repositories? Are you a wizard at social network analysis? Interested in a great summer job looking at what makes software teams work? Even better, want to work with me?</p>

<p><a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/view_project.php?id=1811">The Software Technologies Group at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, NY is looking for summer interns!</a> I started at IBM back in 2007 as an intern and had a great time meeting some of the smartest students from around the world. Students are given a chance to work with the best technology in the world and often end submitting papers to ICSE, CHI, CSCW, or FSE as a result of their work with us.</p>

<p>We suggest that you <a href="https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/job_summary.jsp?job_id=RES-0451733">apply online</a>. If you&#8217;ve got questions you can email directly for more information. But hurry up, as we&#8217;re going to start our selection and interview process soon.</p>

<p>PS. For faculty, this is a great way offload students for the summer if you&#8217;d like to take off to St. Barth&#8217;s for a few months.</p>

<time datetime="2012-01-03T12:29:07-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 3<span>rd</span>, 2012</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In January 2011 I made my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/01/01/2011-personal-development-goals/">2011 Personal Development Goals</a> public. In the spirit of complete transparency, here&#8217;s my scorecard of how I did on my quest to accomplish these goals. I&#8217;m not being quite as hard on these goals as I was on my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/02/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2011/">2011 Open Source predictions</a>, but I&#8217;m still trying to be honest with myself.</p>

<h3>Academic</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Submit papers to FSE, CSCW, and ICSE</strong> - Two out of three. Didn&#8217;t get anything off for ICSE.</li>
<li><strong>Submit at least one journal paper</strong> - Nope, but I&#8217;m getting close on two fronts. Still, I didn&#8217;t make it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Physical</h3>

<p>These are all covered in detail on my <a href="http://twentysixandtwo.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/running-goals-for-2011-looking-back/">Review of 2011 running goals on my running blog</a>. I&#8217;ve shortened the answers here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Run a mile in under 5:50</strong> - Nope. 6:10 was the best I could manage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run a marathon in under 3:50</strong> - Nope, I got close. 3:57:45 in New York.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bench press my own weight</strong> - Utter failure. I don&#8217;t recall ever really trying.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get down to 170 lbs</strong> - I came close. 172ish was my best. I&#8217;m considerably over that right now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barefoot/Vibram race of 10k or more</strong> - Not only did I do a 10k in my Vibrams, I set a PR in the race too. After a bad experience going completely barefoot, I think I&#8217;ll stick with the Vibrams in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run to and from work at least five times</strong> - Never even tried this.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Release a new and interesting Open Source project</strong> - I kinda did this with the release of <a href="https://github.com/pridkett/govscigraph">GovSciGraph</a> but that was something that came out of a work project and not out of my own projects. Therefore I&#8217;m going to say that I missed this goal. Also, no one seems interested in GovSciGraph, so it&#8217;s not much of an Open Source project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visit a new country</strong> - I&#8217;m not certain if Hong Kong and Macau count as they&#8217;re only kinda countries and I had previously traveled to China. I did, however, visit Hungary, Slovakia, and spend far more than my previous eight hours in Austria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read two &#8221;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml">Classics</a>&#8221;</strong> - Success. From the BBC&#8217;s list I read &#8220;Pride and Prejudice&#8221;, &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221;, &#8220;Winnie the Pooh&#8221;, and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221;. Combined with a decent stack of other books this was a decent book reading year for me. I look forward to reading more of these &#8220;Classics&#8221; in the coming year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Win at least two of my existing video games before buying any new ones</strong> - I&#8217;ve been vacillating on this one. I haven&#8217;t bought any console games this year, but I did get some new ones. I traded my DS Lite and games for some Wii games during the summer, which is kinda like buying new games. I got a couple of games for Christmas, but I didn&#8217;t buy them, so I don&#8217;t think they count against my score. However, I&#8217;m going to have to say I failed at this. Stupid iOS games and <a href="http://www.appshopper.com/">AppShopper.com</a> showing me when games go on sale. While you can&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; many of these iOS games, I certainly bought many games and this will keep me occupied for a long time. Maybe sometime this year I can finally win Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, and Fable 2. Also, stop buying iOS games.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spend less than $60 at the cafeteria at work</strong> - 100% success. I never bought lunch at the cafeteria. I bought a few cookies and coffee/tea for some visitors, but according to Mint.com I only spent $24.32 at the cafeteria this year. This is a good thing because the food went significantly downhill from what I&#8217;ve heard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do four &#8220;10 day trials&#8221;</strong> - I tried going vegetarian for ten days, but I had to travel after seven and gave it up. My wife isn&#8217;t too thrilled with this idea of screwing with my body. I&#8217;m not certain if I&#8217;ll repeat it again this year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><del>Cook Creme Brulee</del></strong> - accomplished on 12/27/2010. That&#8217;s what getting a Creme Brulee torch for Christmas will do for you.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking Bad Habits</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Only 12 sodas in the year</strong> - No so good. I didn&#8217;t count, but with 78 flights over the past year I&#8217;m pretty certain I was well over my limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only 6 packs of Starburst in the year</strong> - Complete and utter failure. Target keeps on selling the monster bags for $2 each. Do you have any idea how easy it is to eat a monster bag of Starburst? Furthermore, do you have any idea of what this does to your gut? It&#8217;s not pretty. Fortunately, the vending machines at work no longer stock Starburst.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only 3 visits to McDonalds in the year</strong> - I think I might have been close on this. I can only remember three times, and that includes numerous trips through airports. I&#8217;m going to say I succeeded in this one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall I didn&#8217;t do horrible, but it&#8217;s clear that most of goals where I tried to rid myself of bad habits or be more productive were failures. I&#8217;m either setting the bar too high or I&#8217;m not doing enough to maintain accountability with those goals. In any case, I should revisit my strategy. Sometime in the next few days I&#8217;ll post my goals for 2012. I&#8217;m still working on them for right now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I did for <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2010/">2010</a> and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">2011</a>, I&#8217;ve created a set of predictions for the coming year around Open Source. However, this year I&#8217;ve expanded it to the general field of technology. These are all fairly specific things that I should be able to verify sometime near the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.</p>

<li><p><strong>SOPA dies a bloody death</strong> - While I don&#8217;t think that Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, and Facebook will enact the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/29/1049815/-Internet-giants-seriously-considering-nuclear-option-to-stop-SOPA">&#8220;Nuclear Option&#8221; for stopping SOPA</a> (largely because of business agreements that Google, Amazon, and Facebook all have with other companies), I do expect that if this horribly misguided bill looks like it will pass that they will do something VERY dramatic. This bill is a critical threat to the internet and freedom because it breaks DNS, makes sites more vulnerable to attacks, and circumvents the judicial process. It must be stopped. Also, <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Franken, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re my senator, but you&#8217;ve lost my vote and all future support if you continue to support SOPA and PIPA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy regulations for children under 13 are revisited</strong> - This is a bit of a risky prediction because Congress has enacted hordes of horrible laws under the guise of protecting children. However, as it the internet becomes more important for younger children, it is inevitable that we&#8217;ll need to revisit laws regarding children under 13 using internet services. We can&#8217;t have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google-thanks-for-making-my-daughter-cry/2011/12/12/gIQAhYx9pO_blog.html">Google go around disabling children&#8217;s accounts</a> when they create <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk">ads showing email accounts for children</a>. Facebook likewise faces similar challenges. Maybe we&#8217;ll finally get the point where we inject common sense and let parents do their job of monitoring their children. Or, probably not. In any case, look for child online privacy to be revisited in the next year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Major automobile software fault</strong> - I drive a pretty bare bones car, but many folks like to have cars with all the bells and whistles. According to an <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/this-car-runs-on-code">IEEE Spectrum report, premium cars contain more than 100 million lines of code</a>. I know enough about software to know that&#8217;s a problem. Given that automobile manufacturers seek to reuse components within their own brand, or even <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Auto_IWG">with their competitors</a>, and it is rather difficult to upgrade the software on these automobiles, it is only a matter of time before a major fault shows up across an entire brand. Some people may point to Toyota&#8217;s problem with &#8220;unintended acceleration&#8221;, to which I&#8217;ll gently direct to the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/UA">National Highway Transportation Safety Agency&#8217;s final report on unintended acceleration in Toyota automobiles which found no such evidence</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boxee calls it quits</strong> - Boxee already called it quits on desktop after releasing a completely unusable new version. They&#8217;re facing a mountain of challenges from content providers and hardware manufacturers. The Boxee Box has only been kinda warmly received, and although the <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/live">forthcoming Live TV add on will help</a>, it still only works with ATSC/Clear QAM. Unless they get support for CableCard and recording I don&#8217;t see how Boxee can survive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GNOME falls apart</strong> - <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> has seen better days. Gone are the halcyon days when I used to eagerly await the new release of GNOME in March and September. Now new GNOME releases are more of a &#8220;meh&#8221; thing. With so many things on the web the operating system just doesn&#8217;t matter as much. Combine this with fragmentation among the distros, thanks to Canonical being blockheaded with Unity, and formerly large sponsors dropping away from the project (Maemo, Meego, Tizen, who cares?), and I think that GNOME may reach the breaking point this year. Unfortunately, problems in GNOME will cascade to the rest of the Linux desktop world. By the way, did you hear that 2012 is the year of Linux desktop? Just like it has been every year since I started using the Linux desktop seventeen years ago. Ugh.
<img src="/weblog/media/2012/01/Netflix-2011-Share-Price.png"></p></li>
<li><strong>Netflix gets acquired and Reed Hastings gets fired</strong> - While there have been companies that have been more mismanaged, Tyco and Enron come to mind, there are few that have messed up so spectacularly without violating any laws. Netflix probably did the right thing in trying to jettison the expensive and dying disc business, but going streaming only, which is the way of the future, leaves them at the mercy of the studios. Netflix will be acquired, most likely by a large network provider without content, such as Verizon. There&#8217;s an off chance that given it&#8217;s current $3B valuation it may get swooped up by private capital, but that seems unlikely as private capital lacks both content and distribution mechanisms. In fact, Netflix going private is almost as unlikely as Reed Hastings finishing the year as CEO of Netflix. Need more evidence for this future? Check out their stock price over the past year:</li>

    </figure>


<ol>
<li><p><strong>Go gets a killer project</strong> - I think that <a href="http://golang.org/">Go programming language from Google</a> has a lot of interesting concepts that make it nice alternative to the current dominant languages of Java and C#. Unfortunately, it needs a killer project before people will start to use it (similar to Rails and Ruby). My guess is that this is the year that will happen. Expect Google to show off something big and cool at I/O in June that attracts tens of thousands new developers to the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Android continues to grow, but not at the expense of iOS</strong> - this will be a continuation of current trends. Both Android and iOS are growing. Pundits say this is at the expense of RIM and Microsoft, but in reality its just that its more people moving from feature phones to smart phones that they use only as phones with nice on screen keyboards. iOS will remain the dominant smartphone platform in terms of mindshare.</p></li>

    </figure>


<ol>
<li><p><strong>Internet political meltdown</strong> - After watching the SOPA hearings live it became clear that most of our politicians don&#8217;t have a clue about how the internet and social media work. Even those who have been bitten by the internet (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=santorum">Googled &#8220;Santorum&#8221; before?</a>) don&#8217;t really understand how poor actions and the genius of a single individual can cause such a huge problem. Expect at least one candidate for Federal office (congress or president) to have a meltdown due to something that happened on the Internet. Of course, some might say this already happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_(U.S._politician">George Allen with &#8220;macaca&#8221;</a>#.22Macaca.22_controversy), but I&#8217;m expecting something bigger this year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shakeup at the Free Software Foundation</strong> - Let&#8217;s be perfectly clear: I do not wish ill upon <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">the Free Software Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>. They do great things for freedom and I am eternally in their debt. However, the divide between the FSF and the rest of the Open Source world continues to grow. The GPL is no longer the go-to license for new Open Source projects. Their campaigns against DRM and service based systems are negative campaigns. If you want to win people to your side, do something that gets people excited and presents a better alternative. When that happens the FSF will thrive. Unfortunately, the FSF recently has engaged in childish spats around software freedom and when you lower yourself to that level you have to expect that one of your spokepeople will eventually do something massively stupid and cause a major controversy to ensue.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So, what do you think? Did I pick a bunch of easy predictions for 2012? What do you think will happen this year?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new year means that it is time to revisit <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">the predictions about Open Source and technology in 2011 I made at the end of 2010</a>. As before, I&#8217;ve tried to be entirely honest with my assessment. If I&#8217;ve got something wrong please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll correct it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>On the PC front Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming, although they’ll finally get their act together and make it work well with GPU acceleration. Interfaces for Netflix will all move the route of the PS3 and adopt an HTML based interface.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly true</strong> - Netflix still requires Silverlight, arguably making it the only thing that is keeping Microsoft from killing Silverlight. Apparently the GPU acceleration issue is more due to Silverlight than Netflix, so I can&#8217;t totally fault them there. Although, seriously, Flash and HTML5 both feature GPU acceleration. Most of the interfaces have moved to pure HTML - with the Windows Media Center (developed and supported by Microsoft) and XBox 360 interfaces being notable exceptions. It seems as though Netflix has a Microsoft problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google will meet it’s match and discover that the movie and TV studios really don’t want to work with them and will be forced to pull the plug on Google TV.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly false</strong> - Google TV has had it&#8217;s problems this year. In November, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/11/logitech-says-google-tv-was-a-big-mistake.html">Logitech, one of the biggest supporters or Google TV said it was a huge mistake</a> and had cost them $300 million. Nonetheless, Google TV soldiers on. Given the reduction in support for Windows Media Center, it seems that if Google TV ever got Live TV and timeshifting support it could be a great product. We&#8217;ll see what Google says at I/O this year, but I highly doubt that Google TV is going the way of the dodo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Although Google will continue to tout the number of Android phones available as a success metric for the project, it will continue to see fragmentation and iPhone will remain the phone to beat.</strong>
<strong>True</strong> - I could be generous and describe Android as a clusterfuck. However, I&#8217;ll let <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">this chart about long term Android support</a> do all the talking for me. I realize that the chart talks about support, but it&#8217;s one very major piece of many problems in Android.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Despite all of the Android tablets and the upcoming Blackberry Playbook, the iPad will remain dominant and continue to sell more than all the other tablets combined.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I didn&#8217;t anticipate the Kindle Fire, but given that every other tablet has landed with relatively loud thuds I think this is a safe claim. The iPad is still the tablet to beat in the market. There are tablets that are faster and have more features, but they&#8217;re still chasing the iPad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RIM will introduce a new OS for their phones based on the Playbook’s OS. The OS will be open sourced but will fail to attract any sort of market movement.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/12/07/poor-rim-renames-bbx-blackberry-10-due-to-trademark-woes/">RIM introduced BBX, later renamed Blackberry 10</a>. RIM does provide <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/research-in-motion-announces-bbx-combines-the-best-of-blackber/">over 100 Open Source libraries for Blackberry 10</a>, but the core operating system is not Open Source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chromium OS from Google will land like a lead balloon. Initial reviews of the device will be severely hampered by the inability to access many services without Internet access.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I travel a lot. I see lots of people with lots of gadgets. I&#8217;ve never seen someone with a Chromebook. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/">Early reviews of Chromebooks were less than glowing</a>. I don&#8217;t recall seeing any big push for Chromebooks for the holidays. I&#8217;m open to evidence to the contrary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The browser wars will continue to heat up (hello, 1998!). Firefox’s market share will remain relatively stagnant while Chrome’s market share grows. This stagnation will result in some shakeups at Mozilla as they attempt to re-evaluate the market landscape. This will eventually lead to a new and lighter desktop browser based off Firefox.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - Chrome has continued to gain market share and Firefox has fallen off. However, Mozilla has not experienced any major shakeup. Rather they&#8217;ve become more focused on their core purpose of delivering an open web. It seems as though the browser is secondary, which is probably a good thing overall.
<img src="/weblog/media/2012/01/StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-201012-201112.png"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source hardware outside of Android will generally continue to falter. This includes OLPC and the Boxee Box (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>Kinda True</strong> - Although Boxee is doing better than I would have expected it seems as though the only Open Source consumer hardware people talk about is Android based. I am, however, only marking this as kinda true because the variety of Open Source hardware available for the maker community (arduinos, rep raps, maker bots, lasersaurs, etc), is staggering. I was referring to consumer hardware in the original prediction, but I wasn&#8217;t specific enough to call this completely true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ll see the first lawsuit regarding ownership of code in an Open Source project after the code of an original author has been patched out and the project license changed (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>False</strong> - I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apache will have a significant long term shakeup regarding their relationship with Java. I’d imagine that this means that the Java projects are jettisoned into a new foundation.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly False</strong> - Although Apache has taken it&#8217;s hits this year, mainly because of it being lured into Oracle&#8217;s anti-community trap related to OpenOffice.org, there hasn&#8217;t been a major shakeup.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Total score: 3 completely true, one mostly true, two half true, one kinda true. Assigning point values of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 for each of those categories, my total score is 5. About 50% of a perfect score, although I had some element of truth to 7 out of 10 of my predictions. Not bad, we&#8217;ll see how my career as a pundit progresses in 2012.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately I&#8217;ve had trouble doing anything more than idly browsing the Internet during my non-work hours. Yes, they&#8217;re non-work hours, but I still like that time to be productive. I feel much better after work if I took those few hours and wrote some code than if I just sat around and browsed Reddit all evening. I&#8217;d imagine that the same holds true for most readers of this blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not above using technological gimmicks to keep me from wasting time. While <a href="http://macfreedom.com/">Freedom</a> works great for writers and work situations when everything is on your computer, it&#8217;s not so great for developers who need to read documentation or integrate with other web services. Instead, I&#8217;ve been using browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd</a> to limit the amount of time I can waste during a day or evening on social sites. These tools allow you to configure a set of sites to block after a certain time limit. For example, I now give myself a combined 30 minutes per day between the hours of Midnight and 9:30pm to use most social sites and news sites. It&#8217;s done wonders for my productivity at home.</p>

<p>However, I did notice one interesting thing. The default in StayFocusd is to give 10 minutes a day total. This doesn&#8217;t work because I browse these sites over breakfast each day. Thus, I needed to update my time limit to 30 minutes. I was presented with the following series of dialogs:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd1.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd2.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd3.png"></p>

<p>Although these messages, which all occur as the result of increasing the allotted time on procrastination sites, seem trite, they kinda work. Even the kitten one. Sure, I know there is no kitten given electroshock therapy as a result of my actions, but it does allow me to consider my actions more. In fact, it got me to consider my actions much more than a simple one stage dialog box would have. If it would have been plain writing I don&#8217;t think it would have worked as well, but the guilt of the hypothetical chicken did it to me.</p>

<p>This got me thinking, what if other poor behaviors had similar warnings. A pack of Starburst, to which I am woefully addicted, could read &#8220;Warning: these will add extra pounds to your frame and mess up your running&#8221; or hitting the snooze on my phone could activate a voice that says &#8220;These last five minutes won&#8217;t make you feel any better. Use those five minutes to make a cup of coffee instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any other thoughts on interesting ways to motivate people using technology?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I attended the joint meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the Foundations of Software Engineering Conference earlier this month in Szeged, Hungary. I was fortunate enough to have a paper in the 4th Workshop on Social Software Engineering and also in the main conference.</p>

<h3>Engineering Software Engineering Teams</h3>

<p>This is a short little paper that I wrote based on some observations regarding how software engineering teams share information and coordinate. In short, economics says there are two different models of sharing information &#8211; top down (Keynesian) or bottom up (Austrian). However, as we know, neither is 100% correct. We need to flow information up from the bottom and down from the top. However, simply flowing the information up or down doesn&#8217;t do us much good because the information won&#8217;t get where it is needed. We&#8217;ve noticed that most projects have someone who acts as an intercessor for communications, now we just need to find them.</p>

<h3>The Onion Patch: Migration in Open Source Ecosystems</h3>

<p>A longer paper written with Corey Jergensen and Anita Sarma at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. We analyzed several projects within my large <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/research/gnome">GNOME data set</a> to understand how users actually join a project and how it might expand into an ecosystem. We found that the basic socialization pattern of email, bugs, then code is rarely found on individual projects. Rather, it&#8217;s much more common to find it across the ecosystem. We also identify several ways that individuals can apply shared knowledge across projects in the ecosystem.</p>

<time datetime="2011-09-22T19:34:54-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 22<span>nd</span>, 2011</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Graph databases such as <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>, <a href="http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm">OrientDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.infinitegraph.com/">InifiniteGraph</a> are useful tools for social science researchers because localized queries are a function of only the number of links relative to the nodes in question. In contrast, relational databases, such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, suffer performance degradation as more nodes are added because of the number of entries in join tables and the computational difficulty of finding the relevant edges in the indexes.</p>

<p>For my own research I&#8217;ve been exploring some issues around Open Source software development and Twitter using graph databases, and thus far it&#8217;s been very interesting. However, one thing that I haven&#8217;t yet found is an easy way to maintain version history for nodes and edges. In this entry I discuss a strategy that I&#8217;ve found to be effective for managing revisions of items with a small number of links.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume that you have a system such as a corporate directory where each user has a set of skills that they can self-declare. For example, there may be a user who identifies himself as being an expert in LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python. This can be represented as a very simple graph:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision1.png">
        <figcaption>Simple network showing relation between a user and his declared skills </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This works very well if the only source of data about skills is the user. However, in reality information about a users skills can be obtained from a variety of other resources such as project and work item assignment, natural language processing or artifacts (tweets, email, etc), or surveys of other employees within the company. If that&#8217;s the case we&#8217;ll want to break the source of set of skills into a new node and link it to the user.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision2.png">
        <figcaption>Connection between a user and his skills with an intermediary node to identify the source of the skills </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>If we had multiple sources we&#8217;d just have multiple nodes similar to the cyan node labeled &#8220;User1Skills&#8221; in the diagram above. However, what happens if the user is no longer interested in Python and Apache and instead has concluded that listing Ruby is a better option for his skills? How do we store his updated set of skills? The simplest thing to do is to only look at the current set of skills and loose the data from the previous set of skills.</p>

<p>But that may not be ideal because there&#8217;s a chance that at some point previous states could be very important. For example, what if there was another user, User2, who wrote some critical Python code then later left the company? User1 may be the only person who ever had experience with Python and throwing away this previous state may prove costly. Instead what we can do is to create a new User1Skills node and connect it to User1 with the same CURRENT_SKILLS edge, but also connect it to the previous User1Skills node with an edge labeled PREVIOUS_STATE.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision3.png">
        <figcaption>Managing a single previous state of User1&#8217;s skill set as shown by the PREVIOUS_STATE edge linking to the older state </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This can be easily expanded when to include multiple previous states but creating new User1Skills nodes, linking it to the appropriate skills, changing the destination of the CURRENT_SKILLS link and creating a new PREVIOUS_STATE link to the old state. The advantage is that this method is essentially constant time for the number of previous states as we&#8217;re just rewiring a couple of different nodes.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision4.png">
        <figcaption>Multiple PREVIOUS_STATE edges and nodes can be used to indicate that there are many previous states for this user. Additions of previous states are done in constant time. </figcaption>

<h3>Querying the Graph</h3>

<p>We can continue like this ad infinitum for whenever we get an update of new skills. However at some point we&#8217;ll need to actually traverse this graph to make use of this historic skill sets of individuals in the network. I&#8217;ll talk about three different types of queries: listing all the current skills in the organization, listing User1&#8217;s skills at an arbitrary time in the past, and taking a skill that is not a current skill for any user and figuring out which user had the skill in the past.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll demonstrate the queries using <a href="https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin">Gremlin</a>, a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> based domain specific language for graph traversals. If you&#8217;d like to play along at home, I&#8217;ve made the previous figure available as <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/revisions.graphml">a GraphML file that you can download</a>.</p>

<p>First, lets get started by firing up Gremlin and loading the GraphML file in to the Gremlin REPL.</p>

<h4>Listing All Current Skills in the Organization</h4>

<p>There are two ways to traverse to get all of the currently active skill nodes. Either we can start with each person, follow the CURRENT_SKILLS link and then SKILLS link, or we can can start with each skill and traverse backwards.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='groovy'><span class='line'><span class="n">gremlin</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">V</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">filter</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">it</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getProperty</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;type&quot;</span><span class="o">)==</span><span class="s2">&quot;PERSON&quot;</span><span class="o">}.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;CURRENT_SKILLS&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;SKILL&quot;</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">title</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Starting from the skills themselves requires a bit more logic as we&#8217;ll end up with multiple paths to a person. We take advantage of Gremlin&#8217;s ability to backtrack here and get the information about the actual skills.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>If we were in a more complex environment and wanted to how many times each skill appeared in the set of active skills we could use the following code which counts the number of times each skill title appears in the set:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h4>Listing User1&#8217;s Skills in the Past</h4>

<p>To list all of User1&#8217;s skills at some point in the past we can first need to store when the skill sets were collected. I use a property called timestamp that includes a simple unix timestamp for when the data was collected. Within Groovy (and thus Gremlin), you can get a timestamp for a date using the following bit of code:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Within our the data set I&#8217;ve set the timestamp field of the SKILLSET nodes to be midnight UTC on January 1, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. We can pick a date and then execute the query to get the users skill set as of that date. However, this query is a little messy and needs to utilize the <a href="http://tinkerpop.com/maven2/com/tinkerpop/pipes/0.7/api/com/tinkerpop/pipes/branch/IfThenElsePipe.html">ifThenElse pipe</a> within Gremlin. The reason is because what we really need is a while loop, and the loop mechanism in Gremlin is a do loop.</p>

<h4>Finding out Which User&#8217;s Currently Have the Skill or Had it in the Past</h4>

<p>In this example we&#8217;ll traverse the graph to find the users who at one point in time had the Python skill. As before, because Gremlin only has a do loop and not a while loop, we need to do the crazy ifThenElse condition to check the initial condition. By artfully removing the ifThenElse we can eliminate the condition when a user currently has the skill and only list users who had the skill appear in a previous update.</p>

<h3>Drawbacks and Limitations to the Method</h3>

<p>There are some notable drawbacks to this method. The most notable and obvious is how messy some of these graph traversals are because of the need to use ifThenElse pipes. Fortunately, after pinging people on the Gremlin list it seems as though they&#8217;re amenable to creating different types of pipes include a while pipe.</p>

<p>The other issue is that this mechanism doesn&#8217;t work well for a situation such as <a href="http:/www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. In a system like Twitter where each user can have hundreds or thousands outgoing links this will create a huge number of extra edges that aren&#8217;t actually active but slow down the traversals. Perhaps a better way to handle these links is to add properties to the edges that indicate when the edge was added or removed. I&#8217;ll try to address these in a future post.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions for how to handle revisions in a graph database? Leave them here and maybe we can up with a great solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In addition to being a computer science nerd and a part-time policy wonk, I&#8217;m also a bit of a commercial aviation nut and, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk">Louis CK, I think flying is pretty amazing</a>. This year I&#8217;m on track to take about 75 flights, mainly in the United States, but a few flights to Europe and Asia. For the last two years every one of my flights has been on a <a href="http://www.skyteam.com/">SkyTeam</a> carrier. This isn&#8217;t so much because I think they have the best routes or best frequent flier program, in fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure that <a href="http://www.delta.com/">Delta</a>&#8217;s miles are nearly worthless unless used on partner carriers, but more because of the fact that I often fly into one of Delta&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub#Fortress_hub">fortress hubs</a> and upgrades make travel nicer.</p>

<p>I spent the last two weeks in Europe where I attended the combination meeting of the <a href="http://2011.esec-fse.org/">European Software Engineering Conference and the Foundations of Software Engineering</a> conference in Szeged, Hungary. My original intention was to take Delta directly into Budapest as they offered double miles from JFK, unfortunately, Delta terminated this flight at the end of August, leaving me with the choice between transferring with <a href="http://www.klm.com/">KLM</a> in Amsterdam or <a href="http://www.airfrance.com/">Air France</a> in Paris (technically, <a href="http://www.alitalia.com/">Alitalia</a> also serves this route, but I&#8217;ve never seen their flights in searches for anything but flights to Italy). Price wise the flights through either Paris or Amsterdam were about the same. Normally this would make it an easy decision to transfer in Amsterdam as Paris is horribly laid out, takes forever to transfer in, most of the lounges are outside security, and the thick French accent on the announcements makes them more difficult to understand than even announcements in Chinese airports. Yet I chose to transfer there for four reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had never flown Air France before, so this could be a new experience.</li>
<li>The French are far too sensible to force Backscatter X-Ray or Millimeter Wave machines (aka Porno Scanners) on their passengers.</li>
<li>Unlike the rest of Europe, the Paris airport has drinking fountains. Not as many as a US airport, but enough so you can get some water.</li>
<li>Air France flies the Airbus A380 on the CDG-JFK route once a day.</li>
</ol>


<p>Applying a little flexibility to my travel schedule I was able to get a ticket on the A380. The nerd in me was excited. I&#8217;ve seen the A380 at numerous airports around the world, this would be my chance to ride in one. However, because it was Air France and work only pays for coach I had no hope of an upgrade and wouldn&#8217;t get the premium experience. Furthermore, when I booked the ticket the agent could not get me a seat on the upper deck. Le sigh.</p>

<p>First impression on taking my seat: this thing is ENORMOUS. The planes center or curvature was at the same level as my head, making the walls of the plane bow out from the window seats. The inside was absolutely cavernous. The 747 Transcon is actually a little bit longer than the A380, but the wingspan of the A380 is more than 10m wider (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_planes_comparison.svg">79.8m vs 68.5m</a>). In Addition to the wings being longer, they&#8217;re also wider. Together with a better shape and newer material this made the A380 the quietest plane I think I&#8217;ve ever been on.</p>

        <figcaption>HDR View of an A380 Wing at CDG </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>The A380 also has one of the nicest in flight entertainment systems that I&#8217;ve used. I didn&#8217;t bother to count, but there seemed to be about 80 different movies and a similar number of television shows. It also did some really interesting things like show a view of the tail camera when taking off and landing, which I thought was one of the coolest things ever:</p>

<p>Once we hit about 10,000 feet the system was turned on. It is a combination of a touch screen and removable controller. From the looks of it most people were just using the touch screen. The controller was used for playing games and supposedly allowed you to make calls to the ground. I relaxed and started to watch some movies.</p>

<p>About halfway through my second movie the system for the girl sitting next to me stopped working. She had support for menus but couldn&#8217;t play anything anymore. I started to notice that other people were experiencing a similar phenomenon: either the were stuck on menus, or worse, had crashed out to a white screen. At the end of my second movie I was able to start a third, but my curiosity had taken hold, so I started to play around, and shortly thereafter my screen crashed too.</p>

<p>The astute reader will notice that this appears to be nothing more than a bunch of PHP error messages. It&#8217;s clear that there is a client server architecture and that the menus are nothing more than a bunch of HTML rendered in a web browser. It&#8217;s also painfully clear what the problem is &#8211; the server for this block of seats had reverted to a read-only file system, and unfortunately one of the scripts was having problems with this. There&#8217;s a variety of other pieces of information we can get from this too. For example my IFE&#8217;s IP address was 172.17.64.59, the system was developed by a division of <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/">Thales Group</a> &#8211; a large aerospace firm, this is the Air France customized version 2.50 of the passenger GUI, and that the utils.php file has at least 294 lines in it.</p>

<p>This called for more exploration, so I touched the screen on one of the spots where function.fopen was highlighted, and much to my surprise it worked. I was in a normal web browser. I pulled out the remote and hit the backspace key used for text messaging and it put me on the previous page. Things were getting interesting.</p>

<p>This provided a few more pieces of information about their infrastructure. The main server was running a very outdated version of Apache on a Fedora server that thought it was host d4p1-v133. It also shows that testing standards in this part of Thales were quite poor if I was easily able to get here. The next step was to see if I could get further using the keypad. I took out the handset and began to mash buttons in an attempt to get something that might let me bring up a URL bar. The backspace button worked and moved me back to the previous page. Sadly, the handset had a shift key, but lacked ctrl, alt, and all the function keys that would let me jump there. There was, however a USB port. Most people were using the USB port to charge iPhones. I decided to stick a USB stick in. A screen popped up saying that USB was initialized, but that&#8217;s all it could do. It would be nice if it provided an option to play my media on the stick. Later in the flight I learned that this was because you could purchase some content and download it to your stick.</p>

<p>I also conducted a physical examination of the device. The display itself is about one inch thick with an additional inch of a plastic shielding behind it. This shielding allows for air circulation and also makes it really hard to get at any ports the machine has. Luckily, I have very long and slender fingers and found that there is a single wire entering the machine from the seat that must contain power and network - no luck for surreptitiously jacking into their network. At this point I&#8217;m pretty sure that I was starting to spook out the young French girl on her way to an English school in California sitting next to me, so I ceased with the physical examination. The flight attendants also had enough complaints about the broken system that they made an announcement that they were trying to fix the situation. It was only the IFE units in our section (about 50 seats) that died. Given that there are about 500 seats on the Air France A380, there must be around 10 servers powering IFE.</p>

<p>The flight attendants tried a couple of times to reboot our IFE units from a master control panel somewhere on the plane. Each time the screens would go black with a single blinking cursor in the upper right corner. Then depending on the state of the client when the server went read only you&#8217;d either get un-navigable menus or the error screens like I had. I was actually quite surprised that I didn&#8217;t see a penguin on bootup, but I&#8217;m pretty sure these units were Thales TopSeries units, which means they&#8217;re Linux based. I wanted to explain that it was a problem with the server, but if was probably not worth my time and frankly, after having that stupid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_Security_Screening_Selection">SSSS on my boarding passes</a> for four years in the middle of the last decade, I should try to play nice in the sky.</p>

<p>Overall I can draw a couple of conclusions from this:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not certain why any writing should be done to support a client that is, for the most part, only reading media. This smells of bad design, architecture, or implementation. Probably a combination of all three.</li>
<li>The error screens should have never been shown to users. Even when a system is horribly broken there are ways to make it show an error screen that would say something like &#8220;The IFE System is Curently Unavailable&#8221;.</li>
<li> Next time I fly an A380 I&#8217;m bringing along some other USB gadgets such as a USB keyboard, USB mouse, and USB ethernet dongle. Given the errors that I observed I&#8217;m 90% certain that plugging in a keyboard and hitting Alt-F1 (or Ctrl-Alt-F1) would drop you to a console. From there it would be relatively easy to poke around more and see if the media are using some sort of DRM, which I doubt they are.</li>
</ol>


<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m not going to fly on the A380 again anytime soon. I don&#8217;t have any upcoming trips to Europe or Asia, but if one of my readers cares to poke around and report back I&#8217;d be thankful.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 9/19/2011 09:14 EDT</strong>: The excellent folks behind the <a href="http://twitter.com/nycaviation">@nycaviation</a> twitter account helpfully pointed out that <a href="http://twitter.com/runwaygirl">@runwaygirl</a> <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/11/05/334471/thales-details-ife-offering-on-air-frances-new-a380.html">detailed the AF A380 IFE system and confirmed it is Thales TopSeries</a>.</p>
