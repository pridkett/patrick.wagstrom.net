XSLTRenderer Now Uses libxslt

<!-- Date: 2003-11-01 21:16 -->
<p>
I've hacked together code so the XSLTRenderer plugin can now use
<my:verbatim>libxslt</my:verbatim> to do the transformations on the server
side.  This should be more efficient than shelling out to
<my:verbatim>xsltproc</my:verbatim> all the time.  If I hack away on <a href="http://www.modpython.org/">modpython</a> stuff tomorrow then I might see about getting it
to cache the already read stylesheet in memory.  This would reduce another disk read and make server side rendering even faster.  Yay.

Also, I haven't heard of anyone else who is using it.  I had a few people download copies of it, but no emails
about it yet.  I'll submit it to the pyblosxom plugins page after I do a bit more testing of it.  In the mean
time feel free to email me about it.  You can download the new version from my <a href="/projects/">projects</a> page.
