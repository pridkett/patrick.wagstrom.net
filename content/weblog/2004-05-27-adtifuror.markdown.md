Recently there has been a bit of a furor over the forthcoming book from the
[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution](http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/)
([AdTI](http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/)) that touts how Linus did
not really write the kernel.  I haven't have a chance to read the book yet, but
would like to.  The gist that I've seen, from sources like [Andrew
Tennenbaum](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/) (author of Minix) and
[GrokLaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040523172344599) is that
it's pretty poorly written trash.  I agree with Martin Pool when he says that
if [Microsoft paid for this
report](http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,52973,00.html) they didn't get
much for their money.

Anyway, the writeup on [Martin Pool's
page](http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/issues/adti/) does a good job of dissecting
the book for all to enjoy.  I'm sure that Microsoft will trumpet this trash, so
it's important that everyone be informed.
