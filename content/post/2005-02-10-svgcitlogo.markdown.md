I'm sorta on a mission.  I really need some graphics to brand my
presentations and stuff, but most are of hideous resolution or in
non-editable format.  With that being said, my new hack today is the
[College of Engineering](http://www.cit.cmu.edu/) logo for
[Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cmu.edu/).

For some reason, my SVG viewer doesn't like always displaying these,
but I assure that you can mangle them all you'd like in your favorite
SVG editor.  If you'd like to download them, here is the
[black logo](/media/2005/02/CITblack.svg) and here is the
[blue logo](/media/2005/02/CITblue.svg).
