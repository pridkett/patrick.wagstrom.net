Monitoring your system with SensorGraph

<!-- Date: 2007-03-20 10:59 -->
<p>
One important aspect of keeping a computer healthy and happy is monitoring
its vital stats.  This is especially true of systems that are on 24/7 or
that don't have a traiditional mode of user interaction.  In my case, my
MythTV box fits both of these qualities.  In particular, it's important to
make sure that the fans are running and none of the drives or processors in
the machine are running abnormally hot, as this could indicate a malfunction
within the machine and should be looked at.

Linux provides a multitude of methods to get at various sensor information
on your computer, the most common method is with the lm-sensors package.
This suite of tools interacts with various sensors that are built into most
every piece of x86 compatible hardware.  Typically you'll just use the command
<my:verbatim>sensors</my:verbatim> to get a status list, such this listing
from my MythTV box:

The top little confusing string just indicates what sensors interface the program is using.  Beneath
that is a listing of sensors and their current values, you'll notice that there
are measurements for all of the voltages from your power supply, fan speeds,
and motherboard and cpu temperatures.  It may take a little looking to figure out
what all of these mean and why some of them may not have have values that intially
make sense.  For example, I only have two fans on my system, the CPU fan and northbridge,
which is why it says 0 RPM for the value of fan1.  I've also noticed that the
voltage tends to get confused by powernow setups, especially when you've gone
through and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/linux/custom-powersaving-kernel-for-profit.xml">modified
your DSDT table to save some extra power</a>.  Ensuring that these values are nominally
appropriate is a key element for computer health as if the voltages sway too much
they can cause interference with the PCI bus, as was my problem with pcHDTV cards and
the original Antec power supply in my Antec Overture II case.

While the lm-sensors package monitors lots of things, there are many other
sensors in your system that don't have such a uniform interface.  For example,
you the <my:verbatim>nvclock</my:verbatim> application can provide a wealth
of knowledge surrounding <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/">nvidia</a> video
cards.  Here's a snippet of what you can expect from running <my:verbatim>nvclock -i</my:verbatim>:
</p>
<pre>-- General info --
Card:           nVidia Geforce 6600LE
Architecture:   NV43 A4
PCI id:         0x142
GPU clock:      9.705 MHz
Bustype:        PCI-Express

-- Pipeline info --
Pixel units: 4 (10b)
Vertex units: 3 (111b)
HW masked units: pixel 01b vertex 000b
SW masked units: None

-- Memory info --
Amount:         256 MB
Type:           128 bit DDR
Clock:          12.846 MHz

-- Sensor info --
Sensor: GPU Internal Sensor
GPU temperature: 52C

-- VideoBios information --
Version: 05.43.02.69.02
Signon message: GeForce 6600 LE BIOS
Performance level 0: 300MHz / 400MHz
</pre>

Not only does it correctly identify the exact video card you're using, but it also provides
information about the performance levels and clock rates the card is running at.  Here we
see that when my monitor is off, as it was when I ran this, the card slows itself down to
conserve extra power.  We also see that the interal GPU temperature is 52C.  This is a little
bit of a concern, but should be taken lightly as the card is a first generation fanless
GeForce 6600 and has a fairly poor heat sink.  It frequently overheats in games like
Quake 4.

Not to be left out, hard drives also have an amazing amount of information available at your
finger tips.  Almost every IDE or SATA hard drive out there is compatible with SMART, which
is an automated tested and analysis system for hard drives.  Up until last month, it was
widely thought that temperature and usage loads were high correlated to drive failure,
however thanks to some clever research out of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>,
we've seen that for the most part <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/schroeder.html">failure
rates grow with time</a> and have little to do with other parameters.  Folks from Google
published a similar paper in which they looked at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/pinheiro.html">drive
failures across a large enterprise</a> and found consistent results.  Now it just means that
we can make nifty graphs and re-evaluate if we need more fans in our systems.  Anyway, the
<a href="http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/">smartmontools</a> package is a great set
of tools that monitors drive parameters and can automatically alert you if a drive is going
bad.  Of course, I've had drives that smartmontools was complaining about for years that kept
on working.

Now that you know how to collect all this information, wouldn't it be nice if it were
done automatically and stored in a database with a nice web interface?  Yes it would.  That's
where SensorGraph comes along.  SensorGraph is a python script that reads the values of all
of the sensors and stores them into a database for further analysis.  I typically run the
program once every fifteen minutes.  Then to look at my system, I created a web interface
to SensorGraph that utilizes <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUPlot</a> to create some
SVG graphs for visualization of trends.  Throw in some nice javascript interface, and you've
got yourself a nice little setup to look at your system.  If you'd like to get a copy of
SensorGraph, you can check it out from my subversion at <my:verbatim>https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/sensorGraph</my:verbatim>.
If you'd like to see a demo of sensor graph's web interface, I've put up a <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/test.cgi">small
demo site</a> that uses some static information from my MythTV box.  I would have a live
information setup for my web server, but it's a virtual machine, so most of the sensor
interfaces aren't present or return garbage information.
</p>
<p>
Using all of these tools, I can quickly look at the health of my drives and CPU and tell
if something is going wrong.  It also provides a nice reminder of what days were warmer
because I can see days that the CPU was typically warmer, indicating that it was probably
warmer outside.  Not entirely practical, but perhaps helpful.  In the future I'd like to
add the ability to calculate some trend lines and a sliding window for the graphs to
better get an idea of the health of the machine.
