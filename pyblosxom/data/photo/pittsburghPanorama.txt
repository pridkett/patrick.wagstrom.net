Pittsburgh from the Duquesne Incline

Pittsburgh has seen some absolutely amazing weather this weekend, which
all things considered, is quite rare.  On Saturday,
<a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina</a> and I, along with a
couple of friends decided to ride the inclines on Mount Washington.  The
Monongahela and Duquesne inclines both provide excellent views of the
city and if you're a student at <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">Pitt</a>
or <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a> you get to ride for free.  At
the top of the Duquesne incline I took a couple of pictures and then
pieced together a panorama of the city.  I'm fairly pleased with the results,
the coloration on the camera is a little off, but not bad for our little
point and click camera.
