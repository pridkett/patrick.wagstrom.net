  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I&#8217;ve got plans for a larger scale social network analysis tool in my future, however
for right now, I need to get some of the groundwork laid.  I realize that some of the key
components of such a tool are going to be <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a>,
for handling of scripting various modules, and a good command line interface.  The major
problem that I see with most tools right now is that either they run exclusively in batch
mode or require a GUI.  What I want is a prompt where I can run my analysis as though
I&#8217;m programming.</p>

<p>Anyone who has taken the time to use command prompt programs and programming languages knows
what a great blessing a good input system can be.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned,
<a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a> is the tops
when it comes to this.  However, I was dismayed because there was no obvious binding to provide
support for <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.  That is, until now.</p>

<p>Today I announce the first release of Mono.Readline.  Basically it&#8217;s a little binding that creates
a stub library to allow Mono to access the GNU Readline library.  It&#8217;s hella cool.  And best of
all, I didn&#8217;t really write it.  It&#8217;s mainly ripped out of <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~martin/blog/">Martin
Baulig</a>&#8217;s code in the mono debugger, but this way it&#8217;s easier to use and get access to.  All
in a nice autoconf&#8217;ed package for you.  So go ahead, download <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/projects/personal/mono-readline-0.0.1.tar.gz">mono-readline 0.0.1</a> today!  Please, also let me know what you think about it
as this is the first real package I&#8217;ve put out using the autotools.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone know of a reason why <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> would
sometimes crash my computer while compiling?  More specifically, it seems
related to large projects.  I had the problem several times while compiling
Gentoo over the weekend (one of the major factors that made me go back to
using <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>).  Last night I
experienced the problem while recompiling
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> so I could enjoy XRandR and
<a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> support.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m experiencing some weird problems with JFS related issues.  One
very strange thing about the file system is that it goes read-only when it
detects a consistency error.  I had several of these last night, on both
of my JFS partitions.  Needless to say, it took me a while to figure out what
was going on.  One of the files caused the JFS tools to segfault and die.
Which meant that I really couldn&#8217;t fix it.  Sigh&#8230;Did I mention that I
really hate computers some days?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Run for your lives!  Apparently Cat Stevens is such a dangerous terrorist that
the flight he was on from London to Washington, D.C. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/09/22/plane.diverted.stevens/index.html">diverted</a> because he was
on the terroist watch list.  Here is the kicker, they didn&#8217;t notice he was on
the watch list until AFTER the plane was in the air.  I&#8217;m sorry, this pretty
much verifies that the watch list if FUCKING BULLSHIT and doesn&#8217;t make us more
safe.  Ostensibly the purpose of such a list is to prevent nasty little
terrorist guys from hijacking our planes.  What good does that do on a
trans-atlantic flight if they can&#8217;t stop it until Bangor, ME?</p>

<p>This is just another case of <a href="http://www.stupidsecurity.com/">stupid
security</a> procedures and the Bush administrations attempts to take America
into a police state.  They&#8217;re playing on the fears of Americans, which is
crap.  They&#8217;re only way to stay in power is fear.  Dick Cheney spreads it.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I sacrificed the good part of my weekend getting Gentoo going on my computer
only to boot it.  I realized that I don&#8217;t have the time for such a commitment.
It&#8217;s like buying a nice house, you need to keep it up.  I&#8217;d rather get one that
works well enough and neds a little work here and there.  Thus, I switched
back to <a href="http://ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>.  I managed to get the
driver for <a href="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net">IVTV</a> reinstalled and now
have MythTV almost working again.  My next step is to get the little remote
working with <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> and bind some stuff to
the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/current/Xrandr.3.html">XRandR</a> program
to handle auto-fullscreening.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see how long this lasts.  I can say this, I&#8217;m liking
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jfs/">JFS</a>
on my hard disk.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to finally reinstall the Myth box yesterday.  I found out some
pretty valuable things.  First, a lot of the problems with the box
can be attributed to the motherboard not liking the large amounts of
DMA transfers the WinTV PVR 250 does.  I&#8217;ll have to remember to stay
away from Via chipsets in the future as this chipset also has some
flunky problems under Windows 2000 too.  Bad Via.  Bad bad Via.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&#8217;ve also got a weird bios, strike 2 for Via.  I burned the
minimal Gentoo install CD last night, but it wouldn&#8217;t boot.  Finally, I
gave up and installed <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>
instead.  I gotta say, it&#8217;s a nice desktop opearting system, but there
were some things that made it really annoying.  First is that there was
no way to get a lot of software for it.  Specifically, MPlayer and
XCdRoast.  I figured out how to burn images under Nautilus, but that&#8217;s just
not as much fun.  Apparently this is because of licensing issues.</p>

<p>Also, by default, it installs a VERY stripped down OS.  We&#8217;re talking no C
compiler.  This was annoying.  It also suffers from <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debianism</a> when it comes to kernel compiles.
This made it hard to install <a href="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net/">IvyTV</a>
to drive <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.  Then later I realized
that it didn&#8217;t install an SSH daemon either.  Good for desktop users, bad for
Patrick.  After sleeping on it and dreading needing to reinstall again in a
few months, I decided that I should have installed
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>.  I downloaded the full CD today,
slapped that on a CD-RW and burnt it.  Right now I&#8217;m installing Gentoo.  We&#8217;ll
see how that works.  At least with Gentoo, it&#8217;s braindead on how to upgrade
it.</p>

<p>I wish that Ubuntu would have worked, I&#8217;d really like to support them, but with
my needs and the state of the distro, it&#8217;s not gonna happen right now.  Maybe
when the full release comes out, we&#8217;ll be better off.  Anyway, I&#8217;ll see about
posting more tomorrow once the compile is closer to being done.  Yay for
compiling in Gentoo!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once again I got distracted, imagine that.  So you might know that I&#8217;ve
been interested in a lot of the things that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic Web</a> has to offer.  In particular is the use of MetaData,
such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>, to describe documents.  This
is actually a key part of what I plan on doing in <a href="http://pennave.sourceforge.net/">PennAve</a>.</p>

<p>Along those lines, somehow last night I got distracted by <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a>, so I decided to update <a href="/weblog/foaf.rdf">my foaf
file</a> with the relevant information about me.  I also went a step further
and figured out how to <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/signingFoafFiles">sign</a> my FOAF file.  If I ever get really interested, I&#8217;ll make some more
personal information available in a special <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles">encrypted FOAF file</a>.  But this if fine for now.</p>

<p>I put a little icon on the side of the page advertising how neato FOAF can
be.  Right now it&#8217;s a GIF, I don&#8217;t really like that.  They had some smaller
ones that I&#8217;ll look into also.  Also, there was a nifty SVG one that someone
had, but that will just show up as weird for most people.  But, then again,
I&#8217;d like to think people interested in the sematic web also have support
for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">SVG</a> in their browsers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t done anything to really upgrade my computer in the last three years.
With one notable exception, I purchased a <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_250.html">WinTV-PVR 250</a>
card from <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/">Hauppauge</a> last may and
installed <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>, which at the time had
just gotten suport for the hardware MPEG-2 encoder on the card.</p>

<p>This has been a very nice addition to my computer, especially when I still
lived in Chicago and could have my computer record the BBC World News at
6am every day.  It was a nice way to eat breakfast in the morning and catch
up on the news.</p>

<p>Well, in January I decided that I was watching too much TV.  With two episodes
of The Simpsons, and then one each of Jeopardy and Conan O&#8217;Brien, that just
proved to be far too much.  So I started shutting the computer off most of the
time.  As a consequence, I never bothered to upgrade to 0.15 when it came out.</p>

<p>Saturday, I upgraded to 0.16, and it&#8217;s come a long way.  The program, in general
feels a lot more stable.  I have yet to see if I&#8217;ll still be subject to a lot of
those annoying failures to record shows, but we&#8217;ll see.  It&#8217;s gotten a lot more
complexe, and could really be daunting for the new user also.  But, the UI,
especially the on screen display, look FAR better and more professional.  It
seems to flow nicer.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve realized that there are three main things holding back my performace of
my MythBox at this point.  1) The Athlon 700 processor.  While I can easily
watch TV and record at the same time, that&#8217;s about it.  I can&#8217;t run my web
server or anything else in the background.  If a high priority task comes (or
really any task) it starts to burp.  So no fetching mail or anything else
while MythTV is running.  2) The hard disk.  Let&#8217;s face it, a 4 year old, 4500
RPM, 45GB, ATA66 hard disk is not the best for this sort of thing.  The disk
just CRAWLS.  3) The file system.  Apparently the consensus on the Myth bboards
is that JFS is the king for MythTV becuase it can delete huge files in under
a second.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m left wondering what to do next.  I need to upgrade the mobo/cpu/harddisk
pretty badly.  I also could use a DVD-rom in the box too, as I don&#8217;t have one
of those.  Finally, the <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/hd_3000.html">pcHDTV
HD-3000</a> card looks pretty damn cool because it is designed for Linux
and supports HDTV and NTSC.  Also, it doesn&#8217;t do the broadcast flag.  Which
makes it even better.  Unfortunately, it says that I need a faster computer for
it.  Sigh.  We&#8217;ll just have to wait a bit I guess.</p>
