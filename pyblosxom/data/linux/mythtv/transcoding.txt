Ubuntu NFS Woes Ate My Forrest Gump

The title about sums it up.  Apparently
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> is being bit in the ass by
a rather nasty <a href="https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=6749">NFS
server bug</a> that prevents writing to the NFS drives.  It just creates 0
byte files.  Well, not exactly.
</p>
<p>
I realized that when my laptop (2GHz) is on the wired connnection it can
transcode recorded programs much faster than my master backend (700MHz).  So
I figured I'd have the laptop transcode 
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a> and
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/">Vacation</a> for me.  I went
through and cut out all of the commercials and set the laptop to trim the
files for me.  It seemed like everything was going well enough.  A check on
the NFS directory showed the .nuv.tmp files were be created by
<my:verbatim>mythtranscode</my:verbatim>.  There were a few errors being
spit out by the laptops instance of <my:verbatim>mythbackend</my:verbatim>,
but usually I can ignore those.  Then disaster.  When done transcoding the
original .nuv file is removed and replaced by the .nuv.tmp file.  This failed.
Bye bye Forrest.

<p>
So I'm back to transcoding on the Athlon backend, no biggie, just takes longer.
But I have to wonder, when will I be able to replace Forrest?  Sigh.  Let's hope
the good guys at Ubuntu get this fixed soon.  Until then, DO NOT USE KERNEL
2.6.8.1-5 ON UBUNTU.  At least not if you're running an NFS server, it'll
hork your files and eat your children.
