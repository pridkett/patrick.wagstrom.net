I sacrificed the good part of my weekend getting Gentoo going on my computer
only to boot it.  I realized that I don't have the time for such a commitment.
It's like buying a nice house, you need to keep it up.  I'd rather get one that
works well enough and neds a little work here and there.  Thus, I switched
back to [Ubuntu](http://ubuntulinux.org/).  I managed to get the
driver for [IVTV](http://ivtv.sourceforge.net) reinstalled and now
have MythTV almost working again.  My next step is to get the little remote
working with [LIRC](http://www.lirc.org/) and bind some stuff to
the [XRandR](http://www.xfree86.org/current/Xrandr.3.html) program
to handle auto-fullscreening.






We'll see how long this lasts.  I can say this, I'm liking
[JFS](http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jfs/)
on my hard disk.
