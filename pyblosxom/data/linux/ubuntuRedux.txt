Ubuntu Redux

I sacrificed the good part of my weekend getting Gentoo going on my computer
only to boot it.  I realized that I don't have the time for such a commitment.
It's like buying a nice house, you need to keep it up.  I'd rather get one that
works well enough and neds a little work here and there.  Thus, I switched
back to <a href="http://ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a>.  I managed to get the
driver for <a href="http://ivtv.sourceforge.net">IVTV</a> reinstalled and now
have MythTV almost working again.  My next step is to get the little remote
working with <a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> and bind some stuff to
the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/current/Xrandr.3.html">XRandR</a> program
to handle auto-fullscreening.

We'll see how long this lasts.  I can say this, I'm liking 
<a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jfs/">JFS</a>
on my hard disk.
