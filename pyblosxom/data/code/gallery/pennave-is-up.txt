PennAve is Up!

<p>
Today, more than
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/code/gallery/start.xml">two years
after I started work on a gallery program</a>, I finally
have something that is workable and presentable.  No, I did not spend the last
two years working on this software.  In fact, it's been almost entirely written
since I got back from Honduras and realized that I had 900 or so photos that I
would like to share.
</p>
<p>
The original <a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">PennAve</a> was python based and
used <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">the Python Imaging
Library</a> for resizing the elements.  It also had some cool features like
showing just a subsection of a picture, dynamic resizing to any size, and
that sort of stuff.  Eventually it was supposed to go all multiuser and what
not.  Then <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> exploded and it didn't
seem like such a novel idea anymore.
</p>
<p>
So I had to think about a new way to do stuff.  I started using
<a href="http://www.f-spot.org/">f-spot</a> to manage my photos.  I like the
fact it allows me to create multiple versions of a photo with ease and the
great integration of tagging into it.  It makes a nice slide show too.  From
F-Spot I can export the data to a whole bunch of different systems, none of
which I was a real fan of.  I wanted something that would let me use the
F-Spot data without needing to use some other hokey system.  I figured this
would bring us one step closer to world dominance.  Then I revisited
<a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2005/Nov-27-1.html">Miguel de Icaza's
writing about the Web Desktop</a> and figured this would be a cool starting
point.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it's not quite what Miguel envisioned.
He talked about going all out and making it as an integrated part of the
desktop.  Of course, he envisioned using <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono
libraries</a>.  While I don't have a problem with C#, I realize that my
server runs <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and I'm not
eager to get Mono on there.  Also, there is no desktop on my server, so
integrating it into F-spot was also a no go.
</p>
<p>
The solution?  Whip up a little fun with <a href="http://www.cherrypy.org/">CherryPy</a>,
<a href="http://www.sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a>, and
<a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a>.  A bit more fun with <a href="http://www.libxml.org/">libXML</a>
and things seemed quite nice.  So now, I present for folks to take a gander at,
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/">my PennAve demo site</a>.  If this
seems to continue working well, then I'll put the source up for a nice release
sometime soon.  In the mean time, leave me some feedback on it.  If you'd like
to just browse two major topics, look at <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/tags/15">Bellefield's
Honduras mission photos</a> and photos from <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/tags/667">our
Niagara Falls anniversary trip</a>.
