title: Passed Ph.D. Qualifier

I found out that I passed both parts of my qualifier at "well above the Ph.D.
level."  This means that I need to get new business cards that read Ph.D.
candidate.  In general, the qualifier is biggest hurdle in getting a Ph.D.
Next up is my thesis proposal which I hope to do sometime this summer.  I
should defend sometime in the summer of 2007 (my funding runs out in August
of 2007).
