Here's a tasty little treat for you.  The <a href="http://secondlife.com/community/linux-alpha.php">Linux client</a>
for <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> allows synthetic events to be sent to it.  What's this
mean?  Basically, it means that you can script X input with other programs throught the wonders of XSendEvent.
Where I find this comes in useful is in the places where you have to camp.  Specifically, if you're playing
the horribly named casino game "Death Camp" you can make a killing just by occasionally sending keys to keep
you from going idle and getting kicked of Second Life.  That's exactly what this does.

So here's what you need to do.  Open up subversion and check out <a href="https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/slAntiIdle">https://secure.wagstrom.net/svn/projects/slAntiIdle</a>
then compile it and just run it.  Start it up after you've started Second Life and it should automatically
find your running Second Life client and send a series of alternating up and down keys, once every 30 seconds.  I've
found this is just enough to keep me from going idle.  Plus, if you're walking around, you usually won't notice the
intrusion.  Anyway, now that you've got it loaded, go to a casino with Death Camp.  Camp on a chair, plop the
money in, and let the client run in the background.  I find it's nice just to keep Second Life running in the background
at school like this.  It's a good way to make some nice profit.  Especially if you're cheap like me and don't want
to pay.  We'll so how long this lasts.

Oh yeah, and for <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog/">Kenny</a>, I told you I would start blogging once you went
away for a while.  Hah.  Don't worry, I'll stop by the time you get back from South America.
