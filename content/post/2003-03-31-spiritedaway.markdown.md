So I went out and saw [Spirited
Away](http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/miyazaki/index2.html) and
must say that it was a most triumphant movie.  It was so interesting how it
tended to blur the lines between good and evil. The animation was pretty
impressive too.  This is the first anime that I ever have paid to see in a
theatre, but I think it was well worth the price.

The voice acting in the movie was pretty poor, but that's to be expected
because the nice people at Disney dubbed it into English because Americans
can't read subtitles.  I'm not saying that it was poor enough to distract from
the film much, but it wasn't good enought that they added much.

The most astounding thing really was the story.  In the beginning when Chihiro
is still new to the world is probably the part of the story that is the best as
it causes you develop some questions about people.  It's also interesting
because they made No Face resemeble a lot of the other spirits that came off
the boat.

In any case, I'm not qualified enough to write a full review, but I do suggest
seeing it.  Disney pushed the movie into 800 theatres because it won the
academy award for best animated picture.  Try to catch it before it's gone.
