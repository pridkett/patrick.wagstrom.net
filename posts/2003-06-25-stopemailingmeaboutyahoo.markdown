So I posted [weblog about being banned from yahoo](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/archives/000056.html) and it was dormant for months.  Now I seem to get a comment about every two weeks from people who think I can magically get their yahoo accounts back.  Yup, I've got magic powers on a site I don't care about.  Do you think that I'd be someone who can fix your stupid yahoo account?  Did I even sound like I was sad I got banned?  You people are probably the same type of people who fall for those fake PayPal emails asking you to enter your credit card numbers in an email.
