So we thought that we had won the battle against the [Broadcast Flag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag).  The court decision said that
[FCC](http://www.fcc.gov/) had overstepped their bounds.
Unfortunately this left the possibility for congressional action on the issue.
We had at first thought that it was going to be a new bill, but now we see the
same crap that happened with [Real ID](http://www.unrealid.com/),
namely it has a good chance of being tacked onto an appropriations bill.  This
would virtually mean automatic approval because those things are rarely debated.

So, if you value your freedom to make use of your media and exercise your fair
use rights, then it is **_CRITICAL_** that you contact your senator
today.  Especially if your senator is a member of the appropriations committee.
The [EFF](http://www.eff.org/) has a page to
[contact your senator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_flag)
and [Public Knowledge](http://www.publicknowledge.org/) has a list of
[senator phone numbers](http://www.publicknowledge.org/resources/us-senate-approps-109) ([mirror](http://www.mirrordot.org/stories/8599564d6da19b998eef5eb0a32c6f04/index.html)).

Please, take time to contact your senator.  Especially if you're one of my
friends reading this from Pennsylvania or Illinois (your senators are on the
appropriations committee and influential on the committee too).
