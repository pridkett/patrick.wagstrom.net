Python Module for Graphviz Interaction

<!-- Date: 2003-12-05 17:46 -->
<p>
I'm having to use the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">AT&amp;T Graphviz</a> tools quite a bit for generate graphs for my research.
As I like programming in Python, I decided to write a simple wrapper that would go and call the actual tools.  This wrapper lets you create and save neatly-formatted
dot files and also provides and easy interface to render them.  I use it on an interactive web page to generate graphs on the fly.  It can't load graphviz files yet, not
sure if I'll ever get around to that.  Anyway, you can find that on my <a href="/projects/#pygraphviz">projects page</a>.
