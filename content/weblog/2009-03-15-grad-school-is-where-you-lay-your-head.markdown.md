title: Grad School is Where You Lay Your Head

On Monday, March 9th I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis.  I haven't finished all the little revisions yet, in fact I haven't even opened the email from my advisors yet, but I'm largely finished with grad school.  If you're interested in the thesis or the presentation, you can take a look at my [Patrick's Awesome Thesis Defense Page](http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/defense/) that is part of my [academic home page](http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/).

One nice aspect of grad school is that it afforded a reasonably flexible work schedule and the ability to travel a fair amount.  Some semesters, it was pretty crazy, other times it was pretty relaxed.  It all just depended on how productive I was being at work.  In that spirit, I decided to make a map of all the places that I slept while in grad school.  Each of the markers represents a physical building (or tent, etc), while the lines represent wonderful overnight flights.  I haven't done anything to show how many times I've slept at a location or on a flight, but you get the general idea.
