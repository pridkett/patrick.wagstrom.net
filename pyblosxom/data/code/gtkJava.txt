Java with GTK Look and Feel

I remember seeing swing when it came out six years ago and thinking about how
very cool it looked.  But after six years with almost no UI update it was
starting to get a little stale.  Then I was reading the <a href="http://freedesktop.org/~jg/roadmap.html">Open Source Desktop Technology Roadmap</a>
and noted what was just a little footnote at the bottom.  Apparently Java 1.4.2 supports a GTK look and feel for swing.  This is nice for me as
I already know how to do Swing and don't want to have to learn SWT.

It's especially nice when I consider that there currently isn't a good SVG browser plugin for Firebird under Linux, so I'm probably going to need to
whip up an applet using Batik to do what I really want to do.  Should make it look a little less alien.
