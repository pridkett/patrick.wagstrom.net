Yesterday was a [sad day for baseball](/weblog/random/bye-bye-kirby.xml)
with the surprise death of [Twins](http://www.minnesotatwins.com/)
legend Kirby Puckett.  If something happens to Cal Ripken in the next few days,
I'm just going to curl up in a ball and give up on baseball.  However, today
something good also happened, unfortunately, it taints the sports of baseball.

That's right, [Barry Bonds used drugs](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/03/06/news.excerpt/index.html).  I [talked about this over a year ago](weblog/mlp/barryBondsIsADruggie.xml).  If the allegations are true,
which lets face it, look at the pictures of him and tell me they're not true,
then he deserves to be banned from baseball and have EVERY award stripped from
him.  If they find that other players took steroids, they deserve the same
punishment.   Pete Rose only bet on games, these guys ruined the game.  No, I
think banning them for life might be too easy on them.  For so many kids, people
like Bonds have ruined baseball.  And that makes me very sad.

On the positive side, its a good day beacuse Bonds is exposed for the fraud
that he's always been.  A worthless, jealous, shell of man who took post-menopausal drugs drugs to cover up for his steroid problem.  Sorry Barry, you're no
good.  Sulk away, enjoy those trophies for a little while longer, because
they're going to disappear soon enough.  You'll never make it to Cooperstown,
unlike the real hero we lost yesterday.
