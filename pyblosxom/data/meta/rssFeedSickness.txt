My RSS Feed Is Sick

Apparently my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/index.rss">RSS feed</a> is sick.  I'm
not quite sure why.  There are two major ways that this sickness is showing itself.  Firstly,
it's not putting spaces around links on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">BlogLines</a>.  This
was pointed out by a helpful reader and it appears to be doing it on all my entries.  Secondly,
when I read the entries on <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/blam/">Blam!</a> it really does
a good job of mangling them.
</p>
<p>
I've tracked this down to a few different problems in my setup.  First off, I need to point out that
I'm using <a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/">PyBlosxom 0.82</a> and have no intention
of upgrading.  I've got too many custom modules to deal with.  Anyway, basically PyBlosxom just takes an
entry and pastes the entire contents into the page returned.  While this works well for HTML pages, in
an RSS feed I need to escape all the &lt; and &gt; symbols.  Or at least I think I do.  In any case, I'm
pretty sure the unescaped HTML in the body is confusing Blam!  The unescaped HTML also makes my feed fail
to validate as most of the HTML tags are not defined for RSS.
</p>

The other problem is that I use some custom XML in these pages.  When you view the pages on the web at
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/">http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/</a>, you're really
downloading a plain old XML file.  This XML file has a preprocessor directive that tells your browser
to go grab an XSLT stylesheet to render the page.  If you're using <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=38177&amp;t=82">FireFox</a> to read this, do a view source command to see what I mean.  
Your browser then takes care of transforming the
XML into HTML on the client side.  It's all rather neato.  If you have a browser that can't do this
properly, like Internet Explorer, then the server does it for you, but only for the HTML pages.
This means that when you
download the RSS feed, you still see these weird XML tags because the feed has not been run against my stylesheet.  For example in the RSS feed, you may see something like
<my:verbatim>&lt;my:imagestrip&gt;...&lt;/my:imagestrip&gt;</my:verbatim> instead of a nice row of pictures.  This is my special markup for a strip of images in the web page.
Well, that won't get rendered in your feed reader.  Suckage.
</p>

Fortunately, if we remember that the actual page is XML, we might be able to cook up a solution.  It's
not a secret that I'm not a big fan of the way that PyBlosxom does some stuff, especially how much of
the stuff like RSS is hard coded.  What I can do is cook up an XSLT stylesheet that will take the same
XML that your browser downloads and use that to create an RSS feed.  Which is probably what I'm
going to do.  However, I've got a <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~guestrin/Class/10701/">machine
learning</a> test on Monday and a house to buy a week after that, so don't expect it real soon, but
you never know.   When that happens, I'll also try to make a nice ATOM feed so I can hang out with the
cool kids.
