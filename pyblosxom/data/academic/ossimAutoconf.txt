OSSim now uses Autoconf and friends

For some reason I got an uncontrollable urge to force OSSim to use autoconf,
automake, and assorted friends.  It's kinda nice knowing that I know have
a real set of make files for the project.  Unfortunately, it still is written
in <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">C#</a> which means I'm limited to the
ever increasing set of platforms that have a C# implementation.

Anyway, it proved to be more of a challenge than I thought.  However,
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> has the entire
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/autobook/autobook_toc.html">autobook</a>
online.  This is really helpful and probably the best resource I've found
for the confusion that is Autoconf and Automake.
