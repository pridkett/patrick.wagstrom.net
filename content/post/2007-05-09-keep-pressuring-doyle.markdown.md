title: Keep Pressuring Mike Doyle and PA Legislators on HR 2060
url: /weblog/2007/05/09/keep-pressuring-doyle/
---

Nearly two weeks ago I called [Mike Doyle's Office](http://www.house.gov/doyle/) asking him to support [HR 2060](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h2060:), a bill that would save music and netradio as we know it.  At the time I was told that he was meeting with Representive Inslee soon and hadn't yet made a decision on the bill.  That was understandable given the fact that Inslee introduced the bill the day before I called.

It's now been two weeks and there are [51 cosponsors](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02060:@@@P) of the bill, and growing. Representative Doyle still is no where to be found on the list ofÂ  cosponsors.  In fact, not a single person in Pennsylvania's house delegation is a cosponsor.  The same goes for West Virginia's tiny house presence.  Ohio has a single cosponsor, representative [Tim Ryan (D-OH-17)](http://timryan.house.gov/), who represents northeastern Youngstown and parts of Akron.

I called Representative Doyle again today and was told that no decision had been made yet on the issue.  It's unfortunate that just when Doyle was showing that he may actually be tech savvy, he's dragging his feet on the future of music.
