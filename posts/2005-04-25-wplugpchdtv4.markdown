Ah yes, there's nothing like coming back from seminar to see that you've got
20 [pcHDTV tuner cards](http://www.pchdtv.com/) waiting for you in
your office.  These were prviously written about [here](/weblog/2005/03/wplugPCHDTV), [here](/weblog/2005/04/wplugPCHDTV2), and [here](/weblog/2005/04/wplugPCHDTV3).  In any case, they're in and I've
got a BIG ASS charge on my credit card.  Yay.

For giggles, here's some photographic proof of the cards and me with them.
Unfortunately, they come in really non-descript cardboard boxes, which makes
me a little sad as it makes the pictures a bit more boring.
