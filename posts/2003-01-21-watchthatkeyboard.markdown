It's a good thing that I live in the ghetto where not that many people have computers.  I doubt that anyone above or below me has a wireless keyboard.  My neighbors are old folks who probably don't have a computer.  But in Norway, well there you could be [using the same keyboard as your neighbor](http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=474623) and it might take a while to find out.  Well, not the same keyboard, but you would get interference.  This seems a little odd, I had my computer over at my brothers house, where he also has a Logitech wireless keyboard, and we had no problems there.  ::shrug::
