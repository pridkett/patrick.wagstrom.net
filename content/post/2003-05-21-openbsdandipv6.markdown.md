There used to be a good page at [2600 Australia](http://www.2600.org.au/) about how to set up IPv6 with [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/), sadly that page is gone.  However, I did find a little gem from [SANS](http://www.sans.org/) about [Building an IPv6 Firewall with OpenBSD](http://www.sans.org/rr/paper.php?id=807).  It looks a little up to date as it uses OpenBSD 3.0 (3.3 is the current version right now).  Anyway, when I get all mine set up all nice, I'll post a good walkthrough on how to do it.  Then I'll post another one once I get my computers behind my firewall to work over IPv6 also.
