This is just a little post to pimp my own talk at [WPLUG](http://www.wplug.org/) this weekend.  On Saturday I'll be giving a talk about [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) and the alphabet soup of standards and regulations that accompany it, including NSTC, ATSC, MPEG, and more!  I'll also talk a little bit about the broadcast flag and why we still need to be on the look out for future similar legislation. For those that are interested in seeing a live system, I'll have it running on both my laptop and my desktop while there.  We won't be able to play with live TV but you should get a feel for the other features of the system.  If you've got particular issues you'd like me to talk about, shoot me an email and I'll try to work them in.
