DStat for Fun and Profit

So in my quest to actually get MythTV working well I've been doing a decent
amount of system profiling to check where the bottle neck in my system is.  One
tool that I'fe found really helpful is
<a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/">dstat</a>.  This is basically
a replacement/clone of vmstat, iostat, netstat and other helpful tools.
Really nifty if you want to to help debug issues.
