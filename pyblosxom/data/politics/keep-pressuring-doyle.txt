Keep Pressuring Mike Doyle and PA Legislators on HR 2060

<!-- Date: 2007-05-09 11:26 -->
<p>
Nearly two weeks ago I called <a href="http://www.house.gov/doyle/">Mike
Doyle's Office</a> asking him to support <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h2060:">HR 2060</a>,
a bill that would save music and netradio as we know it.  At the time I
was told that he was meeting with Representive Inslee soon and hadn't
yet made a decision on the bill.  That was understandable given the fact that
Inslee introduced the bill the day before I called.

<p>
It's now been two weeks and there are <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR02060:@@@P">51 cosponsors</a>
of the bill, and growing.  Representaive Doyle still is no where to be found
on the list of cosponsors.  In fact, not a single person in Pennsylvania's
house delegation is a cosponsor.  The same goes for West Virginia's tiny
house presence.  Ohio has a single cosponsor, representative <a href="http://timryan.house.gov/">Tim Ryan (D-OH-17)</a>,
who represents northeastern Youngstown and parts of Akron.
</p>
<p>
I called Representative Doyle again today and was told that no decision had been
made yet on the issue.  It's unfortunate that just when Doyle was showing that he
may actually be tech savvy, he's dragging his feet on the future of music.
