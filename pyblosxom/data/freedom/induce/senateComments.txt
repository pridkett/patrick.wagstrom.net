INDUCE/IICA notes from the Senate Floor

<!-- Date: 2004-06-22 11:15 -->
<p>
The INDUCE bill is really bad bill that somehow has gained bipartisan support
in the Senate.  Basically it makes creating a device that induces copyright
infringement by another a crime.  Under this legislation we would not have
technology like TiVo, the VCR, or home cassette recording because such devices
can be used for infringement.  I think congress is overstepping their bounds
in trying to tie together the criminal and the civil codes here.  Copyright
is a CIVIL offense, they're trying to make inducement a criminal offense.

<p>By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. <b>LEAHY</b>, Mr. <b>FRIST</b>, Mr.
<b>DASCHLE</b>, Mr. <b>GRAHAM</b> of South Carolina, and Mrs. <b>BOXER</b>): 
</p>
<p>S. 2560. A bill to amend chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, relating
to inducement of copyright infringement, and for other purposes; to the
Committee on the Judiciary.
</p>
<p>Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise with my esteemed colleague and friend,
Senator <b>LEAHY</b>, ranking Democrat Member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, to introduce the ``Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of
2004.'' This Act will confirm that creative artists can sue corporations that
profit by encouraging children, teenagers and others to commit illegal or
criminal acts of copyright infringement. Senator <b>LEAHY</b> and I are pleased
that Majority Leader <b>FRIST</b> and Minority Leader <b>DASCHLE</b> and
Senators <b>GRAHAM</b> and <b>BOXER</b> are co-sponsoring this important
bipartisan legislation. 
</p>
<p>It is illegal and immoral to induce or encourage children to commit crimes.
Artists realize that adults who corrupt or exploit the innocence of children
are the worst type of villains. In ``Oliver Twist'', Fagin and Bill Sikes
profited by inducing children to steal. In the film ``Chitty-Chitty
Bang-Bang'', the leering ``Child-Catcher'' lured children into danger with
false promises of ``free lollipops.'' Tragically, some corporations now seem to
think that they can legally profit by inducing children to steal--that they can
legally lure children and others with false promises of ``free music.'' 
</p>
<p>Such beliefs seem common among distributors of so-called peer-to-peer
filesharing (``P2P'') software. These programs are used mostly by children and
college students--about half of their users are children. Users of these
programs routinely violate criminal laws relating to copyright infringement and
pornography distribution. Criminal law defines ``inducement'' as ``that which
leads or tempts to the commission of crime.'' Some P2P software appears to be
the definition of criminal inducement captured in computer code. 
</p>
<p>Distributors of some P2P software admit this. The distributors of
EarthStation 5 state, ``While other peer 2 peer networks like Kazaa or Imesh
continue to deny building their programs for illegal file sharing, at ES5 we
not only admit why we built ES5, we actually promote P2P, endorse file sharing,
and join our users in swapping files!''
</p>
<p>Recently, in the Grokster case,
a Federal court drew similar conclusions about the intent of other distributors
of P2P software. It warned that some P2P distributors ``may have intentionally
structured their businesses to avoid secondary liability for copyright
infringement, while benefiting financially from the illicit draw of their
wares.'' In other words, many P2P distributors may think that they can lawfully
profit by inducing children to break the law and commit crimes. 
</p>
<p>They are dead wrong. America punishes as criminals those who induce others
to commit any criminal act, including copyright infringement. The first
sentence of our Criminal Code states: 
</p>
<blockquote>
Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets,
counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is punishable
as a principal .......
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it is absurd to think that our law might be otherwise. No civilized
country could let sophisticated adults profit by tempting its most vulnerable
citizens--its children--to break the law.
</p>
<p>I think we must understand
how some corporations came to confuse child endangerment with a legal business
model. Their confusion seems to arise from court cases misinterpreting a
well-intended Supreme Court decision that tried to clarify two critical
components of federal law: the law of secondary liability and the law of
copyright. 
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court states that secondary liability is ``imposed in virtually
all areas of the law.'' Secondary liability is universal because its logic is
compelling. It does not absolve lawbreakers of guilt. But it recognizes that we
are all human: We are all more likely to break the law if encouraged or ordered
to do so. Secondary liability thus discourages lawlessness by punishing people
who manipulate others into doing the ``dirty work'' of breaking the law.
Secondary liability usually targets two types of persons: 1. those who induce
others to break the law, and 2. those who control others who break the law. 
</p>
<p>Though secondary liability is nearly ubiquitous, it has almost always
remained as a judge-made, common-law doctrine--and for a good reason. Secondary
liability prevents the use of indirect means to achieve illegal ends.
Consequently, the scope of secondary liability must be flexible--otherwise, it
would just instruct wrong-doers on how to legally encourage or manipulate
others into breaking the law. The common-law judicial process is ideally suited
to evolve flexible secondary-liability rules from the results of many
individual cases. 
</p>
<p>As a result, Congress rarely codifies secondary liability. It has codified
secondary liability to narrow it, as in the Patent Act. Congress has codified
secondary liability in the Criminal Code to ensure that the narrow construction
given criminal statutes would not foreclose secondary liability. In the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, Congress codified a complex balance between opposed
interests that expanded one type of secondary liability and narrowed another.
</p>
<p>Congress has always assumed that infringers could readily induce consumers
to accept infringing copies of works. It thus created ``a potent
arsenal of remedies against an infringer .......'' But secondary liability
often arises if a third party can be ordered or induced to make the infringing
copies. Consequently, only after copying devices became available to people who
might be induced to infringe did questions about secondary liability for
infringement become pressing. 
</p>
<p>In 1984, these questions reached the Supreme Court in Sony Corp. v.
Universal City Studios, Inc. Sony held that the makers of the Betamax VCR could
not be held secondarily liable in a civil suit brought by copyright
holders--even though some consumers would use VCRs to make infringing copies of
copyrighted TV broadcasts.  </p><p>Sony also created a broader limitation on
secondary liability by importing a limitation that that Congress had codified
only in the Patent Act; this was the substantial-noninfringing-use rule, also
called the ``staple article of commerce'' doctrine. Sony intended this rule to
strike, as between creators of works and copying equipment, the same
``balance'' that it had struck under the Patent Act between the
rights of patent holder and makers of staple 
products. 
</p>
<p>Under the Patent Act, the substantial-noninfringing-use rule bars secondary
liability for selling a ``staple'' product that has a ``substantial
noninfringing use''--even if that staple could also be used as a component in
an infringing copy of a patented invention. This rule protects makers of
staples without changing the nature of secondary liability. In particular, it
does not immunize bad actors who intend to distribute ``patent-infringement
kits.'' Even in the rare case of a novel invention that consists only of
``staple'' components, an ``infringement kit'' must bundle components and
include assembly instructions. Neither the bundle nor the instructions will
likely have a ``substantial noninfringing use.'' 
</p>
<p>Sony intended this rule to strike the same admirable ``balance'' under the
Copyright Act. Unfortunately, Sony also proposed that if this rule proved
problematic, Congress should alter it on a technology-by-technology basis. This
proposal was flawed: In 1976, Congress redrafted the Copyright Act to avoid the
need to re-adjust copyrights on a technology-by-technology basis because
legislation could no longer keep pace with technological change. Returning to
this impractical technology-based approach would create an endless procession
of ``tech-mandate'' laws that discriminate between technologies Congress deems
``good'' or ``bad.'' But technologies are rarely inherently either ``good'' or
``bad.'' Most can be used for either purpose; the effect depends on details of
implementation impossible to capture--or predict--in prospective legislation. 
</p>
<p>Of course, the dysfunctional corrective mechanism that Sony proposed would
have become problematic only if the Sony limitation was misunderstood or
misapplied by lower courts. Unfortunately, that has now happened.
</p>
<p>In cases like Napster and Grokster, lower courts misapplied the
substantial-non-infringing-use limitation. These courts forgot about
``balance'' and held that this limitation radically alters secondary liability.
In effect, these cases retained secondary liability's control prong but
collapsed its inducement prong. The results of these cases prove this point:
Napster imposed liability upon a distributor of copying devices who controlled
infringing users; Grokster did not impose liability upon 
distributors who appeared to induce and profit from users' infringement. 
</p>
<p>A secondary-liability rule that punishes control and immunizes inducement is
a public policy disaster. It seems to permit the distribution of ``piracy
machines'' designed to make infringement easy, tempting, and automatic. Even
Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and society suggests that this is
happening. The Center warns that ``it can be extremely difficult for a
non-expert computer user to shut down'' the viral redistribution that can
otherwise automatically make the user an international distributor of
infringing works. The Center notes that the ``complexity of KaZaA's
installation and disabling functions'' may leave many users unaware that they
have become a contributor to global, for-profit copyright piracy.
Unfortunately, ``piracy machines'' designed to mislead their users are just one
of the perverse effects of a secondary liability rule that punishes control and
immunizes inducement. 
</p>
<p>Perhaps the least perverse of these effects has been years of conflict
between the content and technology industries. Content creators sought the
tech-mandate ``corrections'' that Sony proposed. Technology industries opposed
such laws because they too easily foreclose innocent or unforeseen
applications. P2P software illustrates the problem: Today, most P2P software
functions like Earthstation 5's ``piracy machine.'' Yet all agree that
non-piracy-adapted implementations of P2P could have legitimate and beneficial
uses. 
</p>
<p>A rule that punishes only control also produces absurd results. Secondary
liability should focus on intent to use indirect means to achieve illegal ends.
A rule that punishes only control degenerates into inane debate about which
indirect means was used. Thus Napster and Grokster are regulated
differently--though they function similarly from the perspective of the user,
the distributor, or the copyright holder.
</p>
<p>A rule that punishes only
control also acts as a ``tech-mandate'' law: It mandates the use of
technologies that avoid ``control''--regardless of whether they are suited for
a particular task. Napster was punished for processing search requests
efficiently on a centralized search index that it controlled. Grokster escaped
by processing search requests less efficiently on a decentralized search index
that it did not control. Rewarding inefficiency makes little sense. 
</p>
<p>A secondary-liability rule that punishes only control also punishes
consumers: It encourages designers to avoid ``control'' by shifting risks onto
consumers. For example, Napster incurred billion-dollar liability because it
controlled computers housing a search index that located infringing files.
Programs like Kazaa avoid Napster's ``control'' by moving their search indices
onto computers owned by unsuspecting consumers. Consumers were never warned
about the risks of housing these indices. As a result, many consumers,
universities, and businesses now control computers that house
``mini-Napsters''--parts of a search index much like the one that destroyed
Napster. These indices could still impose devastating liability upon anyone who
``controls'' a computer housing them. A secondary-liability rule that punishes
only control thus rewards Kazaa for shifting huge risks onto unsuspecting
consumers, universities and businesses. 
</p>
<p>And search indices are just one of the risks that designers of P2P software
seem to impose upon their young users to avoid control. For example, the
designers of most filesharing software choose to lack the ability to remove or
block access to files known to contain viruses, child pornography or
pornography mislabeled to be appealing to children. This ability could create
``control'' and trigger liability. Aiding distributors of viruses and
pornography may be just an unfortunate side effect of avoiding control while
inducing infringement. 
</p>
<p>A secondary-liability rule that immunizes inducement also encourages
attempts to conceal risks from consumers: It is easier to induce people to take
risks if they are unsure whether they are incurring a risk or its severity. The
interfaces of most P2P software provide no warnings about the severe
consequences of succumbing to the constant temptation of infringement.
</p>
<p>Another risk to users of P2P software arises when pornography
combines with the ``viral redistribution'' that thwarts removal of
infringing copies of works. Most filesharing networks are awash in
pornography, much of it mislabeled, obscene, illegal child
pornography, or harmful to minors. Anyone risks criminal prosecution
if they distribute pornography accessible to minors over these
child-dominated networks. As a result, one P2P distributor who does
distribute ``adult'' content demands that it be protected by access
controls. But every adult who uses this distributor's software as
intended to download one of millions of unprotected pornographic files
automatically makes that pornography available for re-distribution to
millions of children. This distributor has sat silently--knowing that
its software exposes millions of its users to risks of criminal
prosecution that the distributor cannot be paid to endure.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the worst effect of punishing control and rewarding inducement is
that it achieves precisely what Sony sought to avoid: It leaves copyright
holders with an enforcement remedy that is ``merely symbolic'': It seems real,
but it is illusory.
</p>
<p>In theory, a rule that immunizes inducement still
permits enforcement against those induced to infringe. At first, this remedy
seems viable because copyrights have traditionally been enforced in lawsuits
against direct infringers who actually make infringing copies of works. 
</p>
<p>But a fallacy lurks here: The ``direct infringers'' at issue are not the
traditional targets for copyright enforcement. In fact, they are children and
consumers: They are the hundreds of millions of Americans--toddlers to
seniors--who use and enjoy the creative works that copyrights have helped
create. 
</p>
<p>There is no precedent for shifting copyright enforcement toward the end-
users of works. For nearly 200
years, copyright law has been nearly invisible to the millions who used and
enjoyed creative works. Copyright law was invisible to consumers because the
law gave creators and distributors mutual incentives to negotiate the
agreements that ensured that works reached consumers in forms that were safe to
use in foreseeable ways. Now, those incentives are 
collapsing. As a result, artists must now waive their rights or sue consumers--their fans. 
</p>
<p>Worse yet, artists must sue their fans for the sin of misusing devices
designed to be easy and tempting to misuse. That is unfair: When inducement is
the disease, infringement can be seen as just a symptom. Yet artists must
ignore inducers who profit by chanting, ``Hey, kids, infringement is cool, and
we will help you get away with it.'' Instead, artists can only sue kids who
succumb to this temptation. They must leave Fagin to his work--and sue Oliver
Twist.
</p>
<p>This sue-Oliver ``remedy'' is a debacle. For example, immunizing
inducement ensures that artists will have to sue their fans: Inducers
will have both the incentive and the means to thwart less extreme
measures, like educational campaigns. For example, RIAA tried to avoid
lawsuits against filesharers by sending educational instant messages
to infringers. Kazaa, for ``privacy'' reasons, disabled instant
messaging by default in the next version of its software. Lawsuits
then followed.
</p>
<p>And imagine the poor parent who tries to tell a teenager that free
downloading of copyrighted music is illegal. The teenager, confused because
``everyone is doing it,'' consults a leading technology-news site promising a
``trusted source of information for millions of technology consumers.'' There,
the teenager finds a P2P distributor promoting ``Morpheus 4.0, the only
American filesharing software ruled legal by a U.S. federal court.'' This
statement is false: Grokster did not rule Morpheus ``legal''; in fact, the case
only confirmed that downloading copyrighted works is illegal. Below this
misinformation, the teenager will find an independent editorial review rating
Morpheus 4.0 as a ``Recommended'' download and ``an excellent choice'' for
those seeking ``the latest and greatest.'' Who will the teenager believe? 
</p>
<p>Worse yet, if artists must sue only the induced, they just feed the contempt
for copyrights that inducers breed. Inducers know that people induced to break
a law become that law's enemies: Once you break a law, you must either admit
wrongdoing or rationalize your conduct. Rationalization is often so easy. You
can blame the law: Copyright is a stupid law needlessly enshrined in the
Constitution by naives like James Madison. You can blame the victim: Some rock
stars still make money; I do not like the ``business model'' of the record
labels. You can blame the randomness of enforcement: Everyone else was doing
it, so why not me? Anyone who has talked to young people about filesharing has
heard such rationalizations time and again. 
</p>
<p>And forcing artists to ignore inducers and sue the induced locks artists
into a war of attrition that they are unlikely to win. If you imagine
inducement as a bush, this ``remedy'' forces artists to spend their money to
sever each leaf--while the inducer makes money by watering the root. Artists
may not be able to sustain this unending battle. 
</p>
<p>This may let inducers
attempt an extortionate form of ``outsourcing.'' Inducers can increase or
decrease their devices propensity to encourage piracy. Inducers can thus tell
American artists that if the artists pay the inducers to become licensed
distributors of their works, perhaps fewer bad things will happen. Implicitly,
if artists do not pay, perhaps more bad things will happen. Were artists to
succumb to such tactics, jobs and revenues created by the demand for American
creative works would 
go overseas to some unsavory locales. 
</p>
<p>Worst of all, inducers will inevitably target children. Children would be
easily induced to violate complex laws like the Copyright Act. Any child is a
terrible enforcement target. And because most adults never induce children to
break laws, children induced to infringe copyrights would not even be ``bad
kids.'' Indeed, they would probably be smart, mostly law-abiding young people
with bright futures. Innocent, mostly law-abiding children make the worst
enforcement targets--and thus the best ``human shields'' to protect an
inducer's business model. 
</p>
<p>This threat to children is real. Today, artists are suing high-volume
filesharers who cannot be identified until late in the process. One filesharer
sued for violating federal law over 800 times turned out to be a 12-year-old
female honor student. This otherwise law-abiding young girl and her family then
faced ruin by the girl's favorite artists. The public knew that something was
wrong, and it was outraged. So the people who gave that girl an easily misused
toy--and profited from her misuse of it--exploited public outrage with
crocodile tears about the tactics of ``Big Music.'' And then, I imagine, they
laughed all the way to the bank. 
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could not have intended to force artists to sue children
in order to reduce the profits that adults can derive by encouraging children
to break the law. No one would intend that. Yet it seems to be happening.
</p>
<p>These are the inevitable results of a secondary-liability rule that
immunizes inducement. This ``rule'' has created the largest global
piracy rings in history. These rings now create billions of infringing
copies of works, and reap millions in profits for leaders who insulate
themselves from direct involvement in crime by inducing children and
students to ``do the dirty work'' of committing illegal or criminal
acts. These rings then thwart deterrence and condemn attempts to
enforce the law. These rings may now use profits derived from rampant
criminality to extort their way into the legal Internet distribution
market--a market critical to the future of our artists and children.
</p>
<p>This must stop--and stop now. Artists have tried: They targeted
for-profit inducers. But artists were thwarted by a court ruling that
held, in effect, that although artists can sue exploited children and
families into bankruptcy, courts need ``additional legislative
guidance'' to decide whether artists can, instead, sue the
corporations that profit by inducing children to break the law. I find
this assertion wholly inconsistent with the intent of both Congress
and the Supreme Court. But until this fundamentally flawed ruling is
overruled by legislation or higher courts, artists cannot hold
inducers liable for their actions.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, Congress has charged the Department of Justice to
enforce the Criminal Code. In the Criminal Code, Congress made it a
Federal crime to willfully infringe copyrights or to distribute
obscene pornography or child pornography. Congress also made it a
crime to induce anyone--child or adult--to commit any Federal crime.
</p>
<p>Indeed, Congress codified many forms of criminal secondary
liability in the Criminal Code. I have already quoted its first
sentence. Here is its second: ``Whoever willfully causes an act to be
done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense
against the United States, is punishable as a principal.'' One court
has said that this ensures that ``[a] crime may be performed through
an innocent dupe, with the essential element of criminal intent
residing in another person.'' Not coincidentally, some Federal
prosecutors worry that P2P software makes infringement so tempting,
easy and automatic that many of its users will lack criminal
intent. Perhaps--but their relative innocence will not protect their
inducers.
</p>
<p>The Criminal Code also codifies other forms of secondary liability,
like this one: </p>
<blockquote>
If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten any
person in any State ..... in the free exercise or enjoyment of any
right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or the laws of
the United States, ..... [t]hey shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. .....
</blockquote>
<p>These examples of laws imposing secondary criminal liability have
something in common: Congress codified no exceptions for ``substantial
non-criminal uses.'' The message is clear: Those who induce others to
commit crimes cannot avoid prison by showing that some of them
resisted. I will work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that
the Department of Justice enforces the Federal laws that prevent
anyone from inducing violations of any Federal law by our citizens,
our students, or our children.
</p>
<p>Congress, too, must do its part by enacting the Inducing
Infringement of Copyrights Act, S. 2560. This bill will protect
American artists, children and taxpayers by restoring the privately
funded civil remedy crippled by the Grokster ruling. Congress must
act: A Federal court has held that artists can only enforce their
rights by suing exploited children and students pending ``additional
legislative guidance'' about whether artists can, instead, sue the
corporations that profit by inducing children to break laws and commit
crimes.  Silence could be misinterpreted as support for those who
profit by corrupting and endangering others. This bill will restore
the tried, privately funded civil enforcement actions long used to
enforce copyrights.
</p>
<p>This bill will also preserve the Sony ruling without reversing,
abrogating or limiting it. The Inducement Act will simply import and
adapt the Patent Act's concept of ``active inducement'' in order to
cover cases of intentional inducement that were explicitly not at
issue in Sony. The Inducement Act also preserves the Section 512 safe
harbors for Internet service providers.
</p>
<p>The bill also contains a savings clause to ensure that it provides the
``guidance'' courts have requested--not an iron-clad rule of decision for all
possible future cases. This flexibility is critical because just as
infringement cases are fact specific, so should inducement cases center on the
facts of a given case, with courts endowed with the flexibility to impose just
results. This bill does not purport to resolve or affect existing disagreements
about when copies made and used within an 
individual's home environment are permissible and when they are infringing. 
</p>
<p>Rather, this bill is about the intentional inducement of global
distribution of billions of infringing copies of works at the prodding
and instigation of sophisticated corporations that appear to want to
profit from piracy, know better than to break the law themselves, and
try to shield themselves from secondary liability by inducing others
to infringe and then disclaiming control over those individuals.
</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who has worked with us to craft a
bill that addresses this serious threat to children and copyrights
without unduly burdening companies that engage in lawful commerce in
the wide range of devices and programs that can copy digital files. As
Sony illustrates, clear knowledge that a copying device can be used to
infringe does not provide evidence of intent to induce
infringement. It was critical to find a way to narrowly identify the
rare bad actors without implicating the vast majority of companies
that serve both consumers and copyright-holders by providing digital
copying devices--even though these devices, like all devices, can be
misused for unlawful purposes. In particular, I would like to thank
the Business Software Alliance for its invaluable assistance in
crafting a bill that protects existing legitimate technologies and
future innovation in all technologies--including peer-to-peer
networking.
</p>
<p>Senator <b>LEAHY</b> and I look forward to working with all
affected parties to enact this bill and restore the balance and
private enforcement that Sony envisioned. But until Congress can enact
the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act, the duty and authority to
stop inducement that targets children and students resides in the
Department of Justice that Congress has charged to protect artists,
commerce, citizens and children. The Department must act now to
clarify some simple facts: America has never legalized the ``business
model'' of Fagin and Bill Sykes. Modern ChildCatchers cannot lawfully
profit by luring children into crime with false promises of ``free
music.''
</p>
<p>Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2560, the
Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act.
</p>
<p>I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the
<b>RECORD. </b>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S. 2560
</p>
<p><em> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled,</em>
</p>
<p><b>SECTION 1.  SHORT TITLE.</b>
</p>
<p> This Act may be cited as the ``Inducing Infringement of Copyrights
Act of 2004''.
</p>
<p><b>SEC. 2. INTENTIONAL INDUCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.</b>
</p>
<p> Section 501 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding
at the end the following:
</p>
<p> ``(g)(1) In this subsection, the term `intentionally induces'
means intentionally aids, abets, induces, or procures, and intent may
be shown by acts from which a reasonable person would find intent to
induce infringement based upon all relevant information about such
acts then reasonably available to the actor, including whether the
activity relies on infringement for its commercial viability.
</p>
<p>
``(2) Whoever intentionally induces any violation identified in
subsection (a) shall be liable as an infringer.
</p>
<p> ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall enlarge or diminish the
doctrines of vicarious and contributory liability for copyright
infringement or require any court to unjustly withhold or impose any
secondary liability for copyright infringement.''.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nobody can deny that the digital age has
brought many benefits and many challenges to all of us.  In my home
state of Vermont, the Internet has revolutionized how we work and how
we learn: Distance learning brings the best teaching tools right into
rural communities, and new business models let Vermont businesses
reach new and far-flung customers. As suppliers who use the Internet,
we enjoy access to a range of goods and services unimagined when I was
growing up, and the vast panoply of information and entertainment
offerings on the World Wide Web are at the fingertips of many
Vermonters.  Of course, we must work to ensure that everyone can reap
the benefits of the digital age, and I am striving both here in
Washington and in my state to do what is necessary to bring affordable
and reliable Internet access to every household.
</p>

<p>I am confident that, with continued focus and perseverance, the day
of universal access is coming and we will all take part in the many
advantages of the digital age. But there are other problems that
require immediate attention, because they threaten the development of
the web. We will never be able to make the Internet an entirely
trouble-free zone, but we will also never be justified in failing to
make efforts to defend and improve it.
</p>

<p>One important effort to improve it is the bill that I am proud to
introduce today--along with Senators <b>HATCH, DASCHLE, FRIST,
BOXER,</b> and <b>GRAHAM</b> of South Carolina--the ``Inducing
Infringement of Copyright Act of 2004.''
</p>

<p>The ``Inducing Infringement of Copyright Act of 2004'' is a
straightforward bill. Our legislation treats those who induce others
to violate copyrights as infringers themselves. This is not a novel
concept; it is the codification of a long-standing principle of
intellectual property law: that infringement liability reaches not
only direct infringers but also those who intentionally induce illegal
infringement. And while the legal principle is an old one, the
problems of inducement for copyright are a relatively new byproducts
of the digital age--an age in which it is easy, and often profitable,
to induce others to violate copyrights through illegal downloading
from the Internet.
</p>

<p>The principle at the heart of this bill--secondary copyright
liability--has long been in the common law. In fact, such secondary
liability is provided for by statute in the patent law. The patent
code provides liability for inducing infringement and for the sale of
material components of patented machines, when the components are not
a staple article of commerce suitable for substantial non-infringing
use. This is because it has long been relatively simple and
economically worthwhile to induce patent infringement. By contrast,
until recently the ability to illegally download music, books,
software, and films has not existed. Recent developments, however, now
make it necessary for Congress to clarify that this principle also
applies to copyrights.
</p>

<p>What the inducement bill does not do is just as important as what
it does: It does not target technology. Useful legislation on this
topic must address the copyright issue and not demonize certain
software. As a practical matter, if a law is targeted at certain
software, the designers will simply design around the law and render
it useless. And as a matter of effectiveness, if the law addresses
only well-understood present threats, it will necessarily be too
narrow to encompass future technologies that may pose the same threat
to copyrights. A law that deals simply with the copyrights--and their
violation--is far less likely to be circumvented or out-dated before
it can do any good. It will be both broad enough and sufficiently
flexible to accommodate situations we cannot foresee.
</p>

<p>This legislation is also carefully crafted to preserve the doctrine
of ``fair use.'' Indeed by targeting the illegal conduct of those who
have hijacked promising technologies, we can hope that consumers in
the future have more outlets to purchase creative works in a
convenient, portable digital format. Similarly, the bill will continue
to promote the development of new technologies as it will not impose
liability on the manufacturers of copying technology merely because
the possibility exists for abuse. Finally, the bill will not affect
Internet service providers who comply with the safe harbor provisions
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</p>

<p>Copyright law protecting intellectual property is one of the
taproots of our economy and of our creativity as a nation. For
copyright law to work as the Founders intended, it needs effective
enforcement. That means adapting enforcement tools to meet new
challenges, in the digital age or in any age. And that is the
straightforward purpose of this bill.
</p>

<p>I would like to take a moment also to emphasize another important,
if obvious, point about this bill that some detractors have
ignored. The law only penalizes those who intentionally induce others
to infringe copyrights. Thus, the makers of electronic equipment, the
software vendors who sell email and other programs, the Internet
service providers who facilitate access to the Web--all of these
entities have nothing to fear from this bill. So long as they do not
conduct their businesses with the intention of inducing others to
break the law--and I certainly have not heard from anyone who makes
that claim--they should rest easy. The only actors who have anything
to fear are those that are already breaking the law; this bill simply
clarifies and codifies that long-standing doctrine of secondary
liability.
</p>

<p>The ``Inducing Infringement of Copyright Act of 2004'' is a simple
fix to a growing problem. The bill protects the rights inherent in
creative works, while helping to ensure that those same works can be
easily distributed in digital format.
</p>

<p>Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Inducing Infringement of
Copyrights Act of 2004 introduced today by Senators <b>HATCH</b> and
<b>LEAHY</b>. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. The Inducement Act
addresses the growing problem of online piracy--the illegal downloading of
copyrighted music. Piracy is devastating the music community and threatening
other forms of copyrighted work. This commonsense, bipartisan legislation takes
important steps in protecting our Nation's intellectual property. 
</p>

<p>When I return home to Nashville and drive down Music Row, my heart sinks as
I see the ``For Sale'' and ``For Rent'' signs everywhere. The once vibrant
music community is being decimated by online piracy. No one is spared. It is
hitting artists, writers, record companies, performing rights organizations,
and publishers.
</p>

<p>Every month 2.6 billion music files are illegally downloaded using
peer-to-peer networks, and it is not unusual for albums to show up on the
Internet before they make it to the record store. The effect of this theft of
intellectual property is disastrous to the creative industry. In the end,
rampant piracy dries up income and drives away professional musicians. We get
fewer artists and less music.
</p>

<p>Online piracy affects more than just the music industry. It affects a broad
swath of the creative field, including the movie and software industries.
Music, movies, books, and software contribute well over half a trillion dollars
to the U.S. economy each year and support 4.7 million workers. When our
copyright laws are blatantly ignored or threatened, an enormous sector of our
economy and creative culture is threatened. 
</p>

<p>The intent of the
anti-piracy bill being introduced today is simple. It holds liable those who
intentionally induce others to commit illegal acts of copyright infringement.
In other words, it targets the bad actors who are encouraging others to steal.
In addition, the general cause of action in this bill is not new or
revolutionary. It is based on the theory of secondary liability that is found
squarely in our Nation's laws. 
</p>
<p>This bill should not and does not threaten in any manner the further
advancement of technology. It is not a technology mandate. Only individuals or
organizations which profit from intentionally encouraging others to violate our
copyright laws should fear this legislation. It has been carefully crafted and
will be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that its language accurately reflects its
sound intent.
</p>
<p>The future of the music community is with advancing
technology, and I encourage those in the music field to continue to offer
innovative choices to consumers. It is important to recognize, however, that no
one in the music industry or any other intellectual property field can survive
when his or her work is being stolen. Those who are intentionally and actively
encouraging this theft should be held accountable. 
</p>
<p>I would like to thank Senator <em>Hatch</em> for his hard work on this bill
and his dedication to this issue. I would also like to thank Senator
<em>Leahy</em> for his work. This is truly a bipartisan issue, and I look
forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our
intellectual property laws are respected and enforced. 
</p>
