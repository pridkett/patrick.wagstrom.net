So in my quest to actually get MythTV working well I've been doing a decent amount of system profiling to check where the bottle neck in my system is.  One tool that I'fe found really helpful is [dstat](http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/).  This is basically a replacement/clone of vmstat, iostat, netstat and other helpful tools. Really nifty if you want to to help debug issues.
