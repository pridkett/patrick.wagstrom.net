Apparently I won't have to take my time to write my own version of an
Apache XSLT handler.  Behold [mod-xslt2](http://www.mod-xslt2.com/).
It seems like it does everything I want it to do.  Including using the
<xsl-stylesheet ...> header for fetching
XSLT sheets.  Could be a nice combination with [PennAve](http://pennave.sf.net/), of course, it's not difficult to put the translation in PennAve
either.
