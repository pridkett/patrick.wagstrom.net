  <div class="entry-content"><p>I knew I shouldn&#8217;t have gotten too excited about us winning the broadcast flag fight.  Today we lost a much more important fight.  The senate voted 100-0 to approve the supplemental funding for Iraq which had a nice rider of the <a href="http://www.unrealid.com/">Real ID act</a> which will do nothing to make America a safer place.  It just means that now if you&#8217;re a suspected terrorist not only will you not be able to fly, but you won&#8217;t be able to get a job, enter a federal building, open a bank account, or really do anything. I&#8217;m very sad about our eroding rights as American citizens.</p>

<p>Thanks to all my friends who listened to another one of my crazy calls for action and wrote or faxed senators in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, California, and Washington.  I appreciate that all of you were able to see that it was wrong for such an invasive act to be tacked onto a supplementary spending bill for the troops.  I am frankly ashamed that no one even thought to try and remove this part of the bill.  I&#8217;m saddened that so many senators who I though were intelligent voted for this bill without piping up.</p>

<p>This is sorta a cheap plug, but for those of you reading this, you may want to check out <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/">GovTrack</a> for more information (info on this bill is <a href="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-1268">here</a>). It&#8217;s a wonderful site with MASSIVE amounts of information about our government
and also provides lots of different feeds for that information to be sent directly to you.  I use it to track my congress critters and also to track the technology related bills.  Use it.  Keep your congress critters responsible the more people who follow them, the more responsive they&#8217;ll be.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to go cry myself to sleep.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I set up a MythTV Wiki today.  I should be doing work.  But I guess
this was a nice little distraction.  If you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.wplug.org/">WPLUGer</a> who just got
a card stop by and help me fill in some details.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m aware that there is already a <a href="http://www.mythtv.info/">general MythTV wiki</a> but something
about that just bothers me.  It is of such poor quality, and really <a href="http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/">MediaWiki</a> is so much nicer than
<a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a> (I&#8217;m saying this even as a <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> lover).  Anyway, for folks just randomly browsing the web,
feel free to add to it.  It&#8217;s glacially slow right now.  Sorry, it&#8217;s running on my 200MHz box.  I&#8217;ll see
about moving it something faster later.</p>

<p><strong> Note: </strong> As one can probably imagine, my wiki no longer
   exists. Sorry folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In addition to all of the <a href="/weblog/weblog/2005/04/25/wplugpchdtv4">pcHDTV cards</a> I bought last week, I also picked up a shiny new <a href="http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?TabPage=overview&amp;sku=320-4111&amp;category_id=4009&amp;c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19">Dell 2005 FPW</a>. It&#8217;s a beautiful 1600x1050 20.1&#8221;
widescreen LCD.   It&#8217;s also successfully replaced both the monitor and TV that
we had sitting on our entertainment center in the living room.   It took a
little bit of Googling to figure out to get my video card to like the monitor,
but it turns out my trusty MGA G400 works like a charm.
The main thing to remember is that the monitor only handles a 60Hz refresh.
Unlike a regular CRT where this would be unbearable, it&#8217;s not really noticeable
on an LCD.</p>

<p>In short, here&#8217;s the lines you need to dump into your <code>/etc/X11/XF86Config-4</code> or <code>/etc/X11/Xorg.conf</code>.  I
don&#8217;t claim to have discovered these, but they do seem to work for me.</p>

<p>This monitor is quite nice because in addition to taking VGA and DVI input, it
also takes SVIDEO and composite input.  Thus, in addition to having the Myth
box plugged in, I&#8217;ve also got my DVD player plugged into the SVIDEO and and
the VCR plugged into the composite input.  I was able to once again get it
hooked up to DPMS so my remote turns the monitor off, but I don&#8217;t know of way
to force it to change inputs without getting off my butt.  It&#8217;s got a USB hub
on it, would it have been so hard to make it controllable over the USB port?
And yes, I&#8217;ve already looked into this, the monitor shows up strictly as a
USB hub, not as anything else.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, some pictures of my new MythTV hotness.</p>

        <figcaption>The actual MythTV box, a six year old Athlon 700 </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>The first picture shows the complete entertainment center setup.  It still is a bet
messy, I really should hide some of the remotes and keyboard and mouse.  I so
rarely use them anyway.  One of these days we&#8217;re going to get a better set of
speakers too, but I think I&#8217;ll upgrade the box first.</p>

<p>The next pic shows the monitor playing the full frame version of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/">Shrek</a>.  My DVD player doesn&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s
outputting widescreen, so that makes things a little weird.  It&#8217;s a first
generation DVD player from about 1998 or so.  But it does support component
video and digital audio.  Not like our cruddy little stereo could support it
right now anyway.  Fortunately, MythTV automagically detects the 16:10 aspect
ratio of the monitor and scales the output properly.  It also provides a
variety of zoom modes which is very useful for watching HD letterboxed programs
captured over NTSC.  Even for standard full-frame using a 4:3 zoom mode seems to
work nicely and capture most of the screen (only tested on Family Guy and The
Simpsons so far).</p>

<p>The final shot shows the actual computer that runs my MythTV box.  It&#8217;s my
computer from undergrad, complete with stickers from the dot-com bust on it.  A 700MHz Athlon with 768MB of ram and 245G of
hard disk loaded with <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> 4.10 (Warty Warthog).  It runs well enough, but lately has been hiccuping a lot.  I&#8217;m not
sure why.  Video capture is done via a <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_250.html">Hauppauge WinTV PVR-250</a> and now a <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/hd_3000.html">pcHDTV HD 3000</a>.  I can&#8217;t actually play back the
HDTV on this system yet, so if I want to watch it, I need to transcode, which
is really slow.  I&#8217;ve been looking at getting a faster system, Intel machines
seem to do better at the task, but the <a href="http://www.techreport.com/onearticle.x/7417">power consumption is insane</a> not to mention the energy lost as
heat off the chip.  This means I&#8217;ll probably wait a bit longer (end of summer
or so) and then pick up a nice Athlon 64 with the Winchester or Venice core
to save on some power consumption.  Also, atop the box you can see my second
LinkSys WRT54G.  This is loaded with <a href="http://dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT firmware</a> to provide wireless bridging and range extension to my cable modem in
the study upstairs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ah yes, there&#8217;s nothing like coming back from seminar to see that you&#8217;ve got
20 <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com/">pcHDTV tuner cards</a> waiting for you in

got a BIG ASS charge on my credit card.  Yay.</p>

<p>For giggles, here&#8217;s some photographic proof of the cards and me with them.
Unfortunately, they come in really non-descript cardboard boxes, which makes
me a little sad as it makes the pictures a bit more boring.</p>

<time datetime="2005-04-16T09:48:00-04:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 16<span>th</span>, 2005</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Three years ago I purchased a nice copy of Quicken Deluxe 2002 to help manage my finances.  By and large, I&#8217;ve been fairly happy with it.  There were a few features that I never could get running quite properly, namely <a href="http://www.pncbank.com/">PNC Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.netbank/">NetBank</a>, and allowing it to properly manage my savings bonds.  The PNC problem wasn&#8217;t a big deal because that was our spending cash, so we didn&#8217;t want to track it closely (we each get $100/month in our person accounts there). Savings Bonds I got around by using <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/sav/savwizar.htm">Savings Bond Wizard</a> from the Department of Treasury.  This left me with having to do all the NetBank stuff by hand. I could handle that, but it was less than ideal.</p>

<p>Come earlier this year I got a message in Quicken telling me about the <a href="http://web.intuit.com/support/quicken/sunset/">retirment of online services for Quicken 2002</a>.  After reading the message I realized what they were doing.  They were intentionally breaking software that was only three years old and trying to get me to shell out another $60 for a new version of Quicken.  That&#8217;s dumb.  While I admire Intuit for being one company that has been able to stand up against Microsoft, they&#8217;re not doing a very good job of pleasing their customers. Between this and the Turbo Tax boondagle a few years ago, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to use them anymore.</p>

<p>This left me with a few alternatives.  I&#8217;ve got a copy of Quicken 2004 Basic that I could use.  I&#8217;ve never even installed it, it just sits on my shelf.  It was free when I bought Turbo Tax for my 2003 taxes.  My other options were to try a new program or do it by hand.  Actually, doing it by hand is not an option.  I could move to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/money/default.mspx">Microsoft Money</a>, which I&#8217;ve heard good things about, but I don&#8217;t really feel like supporting Microsoft.  That and it&#8217;s a pain to start up <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> every time I want to enter a receipt into my software.</p>

<p>Although I like VMWare, it still sucks having to use it start up my finance software.  The led me to look at finance software that would run on Linux.  I used to use <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">GNUCash</a> once upon a time.  But my finances have become a bit more complicated since then, I&#8217;ve got a mutual fund that I need to track, mortgage payments, and car payments to deal with.  Not to mention that I don&#8217;t believe that GNUCash can download statements from my banks or credit cards. Option number two was <a href="http://jgnash.sourceforge.net/">jGnash</a>, some personal finance software written in Java.  It looks pretty nice and the interface seems sane, but once again, I can&#8217;t download my statements.  Suckage.  I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Java, but am willing to suck it up for something that runs well and does what I need.</p>

<p>The final option I looked at was <a href="http://www.moneydance.com/">Moneydance</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure why this popped back into my head, but I remembered seeing an old <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/28/1811250.shtml?tid=185">slashdot article on Moneydance 2003</a>.  I went to the site, downloaded a trial copy and started playing around with it.  It definately takes some getting used to, but after a short time Moneydance could download most of my account statements. I still haven&#8217;t quite figured out how to get it to download my Fidelity or PNC Bank accounts, but I don&#8217;t track those as closely as I should.  I had no problems importing all of my data from Quicken either.  I just exported  verything as a QIF file and Moneydance imported it with no difficulty.</p>

<p>Another great thing about Moneydance is that it is <a href="http://moneydance.com/developer.shtml">hackable</a>.  There is a good extension kit available to write extensions in Java and a python shell is available.  Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t been able to find any real python scripts for it.  I wrote a short little test script that prints out the balance of each account in the shell window.  Having a hackable finance program is something I&#8217;ve been in search of for a long time.  I&#8217;d love to have a simple web page I can go to, enter some information about transactions and have my program automatically pull them up next time I open it up.  This seems like it might be doable under Moneydance.  It&#8217;s strange that so many people talk highly of the ability to hack moneydance but never get around to it.  I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ll hack it some.  It&#8217;s in my nature.  Not to mention, hacking new UIs using <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> is actually quite nice (I&#8217;ve previously written some UI stuff in Jython for <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/projects/graphs/guess.html">GUESS</a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Moneydance is still closed source, and this is the part that makes baby Richard Stallman cry.  I&#8217;m probably going to shell out the $30 for it regardless.  It&#8217;s supported by basically a one man company, which makes me worry some, but it seems to have an active user community.  In the past Sean Reilly had to finagle with <a href="http://www.appgen.com/">AppGen</a> to get the rights to the software, so I don&#8217;t imagine he&#8217;s going to give up on them that fast.  Anyway, I&#8217;ve finally got a piece of personal finance software that I don&#8217;t feel filthy dirty for using and that runs on Linux.  I guess it&#8217;s a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>As for my savings bonds issue, that&#8217;s a completely moot point because of the most excellent <a href="http://gbonds.sf.net/">GBonds</a> program.  I highly recommend it for folks using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks ago I posted about <a href="/weblog/weblog/2005/03/wplugPCHDTV.xml">The Great WPLUG pcHDTV Buy </a>and how I was I hoping to get 10 cards organized in a purchase.  Beyond my expectations, we managed to get almost 17 people to purchase cards.  This is 17 more people who are standing up and saying that the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> must stop this lunacy with regulating content and the <a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag/">broadcast flag</a>. This is 17 more people who are exercising their rights to preserve data from the wireless spectrum that by definition belongs to the public.</p>

<p>If you missed the purchase then there still is a bit of time.   You can buy the cards until June 30.  After that point, the man puts the smack down on our fair use goodness.  If you&#8217;re a member of <a href="http://wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> you can use the code WPLUG for another $5 off.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be giving a talk on these issues on June 4 at the <a href="http://wplug.org/">WPLUG</a> meeting.  The first part will be about <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> and the second part (post lunch) will be helping people to build these things. Trust me, you want to miss it.  We&#8217;re gonna have some free goodies from the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> there too. With any luck we&#8217;ll have some media folks come visit us too and get a good article in the <a href="http://post-gazette.com/">Post-Gazette</a>.</p>

<p>The cards should be here sometime next week.  I&#8217;ll deliver them no later than the April 30 WPLUG/PghSage meeting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of our move, I&#8217;m also going to have to move
<a href="http://scissors.wagstrom.net/">scissors</a>, the little computer that
powers this web page.  I&#8217;ll try to keep down time to a minimum, but I can&#8217;t
guarantee anything.  So expect the page to die for a few days sometime next
week.  Yes <a href="http://kenneths.org/flog/">Kenneth</a>, this means you&#8217;ll
need to find something else to do at work for a day or three.</p>

<p>I was a little shocked when I called <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> to inquire about transferring my
service.  Right now I pay $13.09 a month for basic cable channels and $42.95
a month for cable modem service.  To transfer my service I&#8217;d have to pay
$24 for a new hookup to our new house (even though I&#8217;m fairly certain we already
have a hookup, I should plug in the TV and see if it&#8217;s live).  On top of the
$24 fee, I&#8217;d still have to pay the same rate I&#8217;m paying today.</p>

<p>Seeking to be completely honest, I asked what would happen if my wife signed
up for a new account, would she get the discount?  The answer was yes.  I
then asked a clarification question: &#8220;Let me see if I understand.  If I do
a transfer, I continue to pay $56 a month and need to pay a $24 transfer fee,
but if she signs up we pay $44 a month for a year and just pay a $27
installation fee?&#8221;  &#8220;Yes&#8221;  &#8220;So what&#8217;s to keep me from doing that?&#8221;  &#8220;Well,
you would loose all of your comcast email.&#8221;  &#8220;I don&#8217;t use comcast for email.&#8221;
&#8220;Then nothing I guess&#8221;.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s not what I could call a complete sanctioning of my activity from Comcast, it makes
me wonder about the viability of such business models.  Mobile carriers
realized a while back that to keep customers they need to provide better benefits to existing customers than they provide to new customers (my low rate from
<a href="http://www.sprintpcs.com/">Sprint</a> is evidence of this).  Why is it not the same with
high speed internet?  It probably has something to do with the lack of
competition.</p>

<p>In Pittsburgh, we have our choice between cable and DSL, just like most places
in America.  Cable is provided only by Comcast.  DSL is mainly verizon, although
I&#8217;ve read that I can also get it through <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/">SpeakEasy</a> with their nifty OneLink service (but I&#8217;m not entirely sure).
In any case, what it comes down to is that all of these options are more
expensive for a lesser quality link.  The biggest issue is the huge
infrastructure costs in getting to folks.  Unless someone has the money to sink
in infrastructure, they can&#8217;t do anyting, so we see no real innovation.  Sigh, so I&#8217;m stuck with comcast.  Well, at least unless I want to pay more.  Here&#8217;s
hoping for WiMax.</p>
