[Wired](http://www.wired.com/) has a [nice article](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/lessig_pr.html) up about Lawrence Lessig and how he will soon be arguing Eldred vs Ashcroft in the Supreme Court.  It's a good read first to get an idea about who he is, but it also provides some interesting backdrops to the case.
