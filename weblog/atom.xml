    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/05/10/static-bloggin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first new post written in markdown for the static version
of
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog">patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog</a>. The
only reason I was running both PHP and MySQL on my server was to host
wordpress which became a pain in the ass with all of the
upgrades. This eliminates all of those nasty security holes and allows
me to focus a little bit more on just writing. Which is what a weblog
is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m running <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is a blogging
framework based on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The downside to
this is that means that it cannot accomodate dynamic elements,
therefore all comments need to be farmed off to an external
service. Fortunately, I was already using
<a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">IntenseDebate</a>. With only a very small
amount of work I was able to migrate everything over to the new
system. Perhaps most substantial is that I had to write a patch to
Octopress to support IntenseDebate. I&#8217;ve since created a
<a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/pull/557">pull request for IntenseDebate support</a>
on Github. Hopefully the authors will see fit to pull it in.</p>

<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s a little more work now that I don&#8217;t have a web interface
to do things like manage images and remember my links, but I can write
posts from any text editor, which is VERY handy for when I&#8217;m stuck in
airplanes and too cheap to pay for WiFi.</p>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m not certain if this is a good idea. In the past I&#8217;ve
extolled various reasons why
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2008/12/10/youre-too-smart-to-do-it-yourself/">you shouldn&#8217;t try to do it yourself</a>. However
there is also merit to doing it yourself. Up until this point I&#8217;ve
been an active Ruby Hater, and it&#8217;s becoming clear that I should at
least be peripherally aware of what Ruby can do. Although my
extensions to this point have not involved hacking Ruby, it might at
some point in the future.</p>

<p>So, for now, enjoy the fact that every post is showing up again in
your RSS reader and marvel at the beautiful new theme. With no more
worries about annoying security faults and a faster response time.</p>

    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/28/i-am-not-a-climatologist-and-neither-are-most-of-these-people</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past couple of days I have twice received an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577171531838421366.html?mod=WSJ_hp_mostpop_read">opinion piece from the Wall Street Journal which suggests that the models used for estimating climate change are grossly pessimistic and that we really need not be concerned with anthropogenic climate change</a>. It was signed by sixteen scientists and engineers. The problem is that almost none of these people are climatologists - which is the field they are claiming is producing invalid science. Anyone can call themselves a scientist - having a Ph.D. helps - but, just because you are a scientist does not mean that you can speak authoritatively on all issues related to science. Stephen Hawking is a brilliant scientist, but he studies astrophysics, not climatology. I trust him on a lot of things, but I wouldn&#8217;t trust him on climate change. Nor would I trust Albert Einstein, Louis Pastuer, Marie Curie, or Isaac Newton on issues of climate change.</p>

<p>So, who are these climate change deniers that have the right frothing at the mouth again? Let&#8217;s take a quick look.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_All%C3%A8gre">Claude Allegre</a>, former director of the Institute for the Study of the Earth, University of Paris</strong> - Is a geochemist, which might make him qualified. It&#8217;s hard to tell as he has spent most of his time doing political work recently. He appears to have a strong contrarian streak, such as in 1996 when he insisted that asbestos was harmless and that anger over it was caused by mass hysteria. That last time I checked the link between asbestos and mesothelioma was pretty firm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Scott_Armstrong">J. Scott Armstrong</a>, cofounder of the Journal of Forecasting and the International Journal of Forecasting</strong> - This one gave me a decent chuckle. At first I thought he was a climate forecasting scientist, nope. Armstrong&#8217;s expertise is in marketing style forecasting, as in trends. His journal is also published by Elsevier. I think I threw up a little in my mouth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/faculty/labheads/JanBreslow/">Jan Breslow</a>, head of the Laboratory of Biochemical Genetics and Metabolism, Rockefeller University</strong> - A medical doctor and not a climatologist. Breslow is perhaps most well known for his work on heart disease. This is great work he has done, but it&#8217;s not atmospheric science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.marshall.org/experts.php?id=252">Roger Cohen</a>, fellow, American Physical Society</strong> - It&#8217;s difficult to find information on Cohen. Prior to retirement he worked for ExxonMobil research, but that&#8217;s about all I can find. I can&#8217;t seem to find any publications on any issue. However, he does have a very common name, making him hard to google. He frequently consort with William Happer, who appears later in the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_E._David_Jr.">Edward David</a>, member, National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences</strong> - As a member of the National Academy of Engineering I have great respect for Dr. David. However, he is an electrical engineer and has been largely retired from research for more than 20 years. Did I mention he was director of research at Exxon from 1977-1985?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Happer">William Happer</a>, professor of physics, Princeton</strong> - Seems to have moved away from research as he&#8217;s advanced in his career. During his prime he was a leader in the field of spectroscopy. Which, in case you didn&#8217;t know, has nothing to do with climate change. During his 2009 testimony to congress he indicated that an increase in CO2 is good for the planet because it&#8217;s good for plants. Yes, very much like the Competitive Enterprise Institute&#8217;s &#8220;CO2, We Call it Life&#8221; vieo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sp.phy.cam.ac.uk/SPWeb/home/mjk1.html">Michael Kelly</a>, professor of technology, University of Cambridge, U.K.</strong> - Kelly primarily works on semi-conductors, specifically SRAM. He is not a climatologist or even a chemical engineer or chemist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=William_Kininmonth">William Kininmonth</a>, former head of climate research at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology</strong> - Kininmonth is, perhaps, a meteorologist, although there is little information easily available about his activities. It is known that he is not a prominent researcher in any field and his &#8220;Australasian Climate Research Institute&#8221; is run out of his home and appears to be only his own writings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a>, professor of atmospheric sciences, MIT</strong> - Lindzen is perhaps the most qualified individual on this list. He is well known for his skepticism of anthropogenic climate change. He stands out from the other signatories because he can speak with true scientific authority on the issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.mii.vt.edu/MACR/faculty/mcgrath.html">James McGrath</a>, professor of chemistry, Virginia Technical University</strong> - McGrath studies polymers and fuel cells. He is a scientist, but not a climate scientist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.fas.org/about/bio/nichols.html">Rodney Nichols</a>, former president and CEO of the New York Academy of Sciences</strong> - This one took me a while longer to find out information about. I believe that Dr. Nichols is a physicist from Harvard, which means he could be a climatologist. However, looking at his publication record for the last 40 years you&#8217;ll find that most of his work is dealing with science and technology policy &#8211; issues that are close to my heart. However, this doesn&#8217;t qualify him as a climatologist. I&#8217;m sure he is well learned in a variety of topics, but I don&#8217;t believe he has a deep knowledge of the current research on climatology.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Rutan">Burt Rutan</a>, aerospace engineer, designer of Voyager and SpaceShipOne</strong> - I have great respect for Burt Rutan and his creations. He has done a huge amount to make space accessible for all. However, he&#8217;s an aerospace engineer, a field which studies the design of aircraft, not the atmosphere or climate science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Schmitt">Harrison H. Schmitt</a>, Apollo 17 astronaut and former U.S. senator</strong> - As an astronaut Harrison Schmitt was on the mission that took the famous &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble">Blue Marble</a>&#8221; picture of the earth. In fact, evidence indicates that Schmitt most likely took the photo that has been credited with being a critical catalyst for the environment movement in the 1970&#8217;s. Outside of his astronaut career he was a university professor, geologist, and senator from New Mexico. None of these are related to the atmosphere or climate science.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nir_Shaviv">Nir Shaviv</a>, professor of astrophysics, Hebrew University, Jerusalem</strong> - Shaviv is primarily an astrophysicst known for his work on cosmic rays and luminosity. He has his own theory of global warming which says that the cosmic rays of the sun are responsible for global warming. His theory has not been widely accepted and has faced great challenges because of the fact that the solar output has been decreasing since the mid 1980&#8217;s.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Tennekes">Henk Tennekes</a>, former director, Royal Dutch Meteorological Service</strong> - Also a professor of Aeronautical Engineering at Penn State, Tennekes is most well known for his work on turbulence in airflows. In fact, he literally wrote the book on it. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not a book on climate change. He was reportedly ousted from the Royal Dutch Meteorologic Service for his denial of climate change and his sometimes reliance on biblical texts for justification. Look, I&#8217;m a Christian and a scientist, but I realize that I can&#8217;t use biblical texts to justify my work, that&#8217;s not how science works.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonino_Zichichi">Antonio Zichichi</a>, president of the World Federation of Scientists, Geneva</strong> - Primarily a sub-nuclear physicist who has worked at labs like CERN and FermiLab. His title of President of the World Federation of Scientists is self bestowed as he is the founder. It should not be considered to be an analog to the Federation of American Scientists. He is a highly cited researcher, and has done significant work in popularizing science in Italy, but he is not a climatologist.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Out of the sixteen people listed I count one atmospheric scientist, Lindzen, and a half, Allegre. In any community of scientists you&#8217;ll have dissenters. The fact that they could round up only one and a half climate scientists for this letter should show you just how strong the case for global warming really is. Want more evidence? 255 scientists, all members of the National Academy of Science, including 11 Nobel laureates wrote a scathing response, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/689.full">rejected by the Wall Street Journal and later published in Science</a>.</p>

<p>Are you one of the best software engineering students in the world? Do you dig mining software repositories? Are you a wizard at social network analysis? Interested in a great summer job looking at what makes software teams work? Even better, want to work with me?</p>

<p><a href="http://researcher.ibm.com/view_project.php?id=1811">The Software Technologies Group at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, NY is looking for summer interns!</a> I started at IBM back in 2007 as an intern and had a great time meeting some of the smartest students from around the world. Students are given a chance to work with the best technology in the world and often end submitting papers to ICSE, CHI, CSCW, or FSE as a result of their work with us.</p>

<p>We suggest that you <a href="https://jobs3.netmedia1.com/cp/job_summary.jsp?job_id=RES-0451733">apply online</a>. If you&#8217;ve got questions you can email directly for more information. But hurry up, as we&#8217;re going to start our selection and interview process soon.</p>

<p>PS. For faculty, this is a great way offload students for the summer if you&#8217;d like to take off to St. Barth&#8217;s for a few months.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/03/a-review-of-2011-personal-development-goals/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-03T12:29:07-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/03/a-review-of-2011-personal-development-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In January 2011 I made my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/01/01/2011-personal-development-goals/">2011 Personal Development Goals</a> public. In the spirit of complete transparency, here&#8217;s my scorecard of how I did on my quest to accomplish these goals. I&#8217;m not being quite as hard on these goals as I was on my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/02/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2011/">2011 Open Source predictions</a>, but I&#8217;m still trying to be honest with myself.</p>

<h3>Academic</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Submit papers to FSE, CSCW, and ICSE</strong> - Two out of three. Didn&#8217;t get anything off for ICSE.</li>
<li><strong>Submit at least one journal paper</strong> - Nope, but I&#8217;m getting close on two fronts. Still, I didn&#8217;t make it.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Physical</h3>

<p>These are all covered in detail on my <a href="http://twentysixandtwo.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/running-goals-for-2011-looking-back/">Review of 2011 running goals on my running blog</a>. I&#8217;ve shortened the answers here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Run a mile in under 5:50</strong> - Nope. 6:10 was the best I could manage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run a marathon in under 3:50</strong> - Nope, I got close. 3:57:45 in New York.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bench press my own weight</strong> - Utter failure. I don&#8217;t recall ever really trying.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get down to 170 lbs</strong> - I came close. 172ish was my best. I&#8217;m considerably over that right now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barefoot/Vibram race of 10k or more</strong> - Not only did I do a 10k in my Vibrams, I set a PR in the race too. After a bad experience going completely barefoot, I think I&#8217;ll stick with the Vibrams in the future.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run to and from work at least five times</strong> - Never even tried this.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Release a new and interesting Open Source project</strong> - I kinda did this with the release of <a href="https://github.com/pridkett/govscigraph">GovSciGraph</a> but that was something that came out of a work project and not out of my own projects. Therefore I&#8217;m going to say that I missed this goal. Also, no one seems interested in GovSciGraph, so it&#8217;s not much of an Open Source project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Visit a new country</strong> - I&#8217;m not certain if Hong Kong and Macau count as they&#8217;re only kinda countries and I had previously traveled to China. I did, however, visit Hungary, Slovakia, and spend far more than my previous eight hours in Austria.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read two &#8221;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml">Classics</a>&#8221;</strong> - Success. From the BBC&#8217;s list I read &#8220;Pride and Prejudice&#8221;, &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221;, &#8220;Winnie the Pooh&#8221;, and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221;. Combined with a decent stack of other books this was a decent book reading year for me. I look forward to reading more of these &#8220;Classics&#8221; in the coming year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Win at least two of my existing video games before buying any new ones</strong> - I&#8217;ve been vacillating on this one. I haven&#8217;t bought any console games this year, but I did get some new ones. I traded my DS Lite and games for some Wii games during the summer, which is kinda like buying new games. I got a couple of games for Christmas, but I didn&#8217;t buy them, so I don&#8217;t think they count against my score. However, I&#8217;m going to have to say I failed at this. Stupid iOS games and <a href="http://www.appshopper.com/">AppShopper.com</a> showing me when games go on sale. While you can&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; many of these iOS games, I certainly bought many games and this will keep me occupied for a long time. Maybe sometime this year I can finally win Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, and Fable 2. Also, stop buying iOS games.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spend less than $60 at the cafeteria at work</strong> - 100% success. I never bought lunch at the cafeteria. I bought a few cookies and coffee/tea for some visitors, but according to Mint.com I only spent $24.32 at the cafeteria this year. This is a good thing because the food went significantly downhill from what I&#8217;ve heard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do four &#8220;10 day trials&#8221;</strong> - I tried going vegetarian for ten days, but I had to travel after seven and gave it up. My wife isn&#8217;t too thrilled with this idea of screwing with my body. I&#8217;m not certain if I&#8217;ll repeat it again this year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><del>Cook Creme Brulee</del></strong> - accomplished on 12/27/2010. That&#8217;s what getting a Creme Brulee torch for Christmas will do for you.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking Bad Habits</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Only 12 sodas in the year</strong> - No so good. I didn&#8217;t count, but with 78 flights over the past year I&#8217;m pretty certain I was well over my limit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only 6 packs of Starburst in the year</strong> - Complete and utter failure. Target keeps on selling the monster bags for $2 each. Do you have any idea how easy it is to eat a monster bag of Starburst? Furthermore, do you have any idea of what this does to your gut? It&#8217;s not pretty. Fortunately, the vending machines at work no longer stock Starburst.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only 3 visits to McDonalds in the year</strong> - I think I might have been close on this. I can only remember three times, and that includes numerous trips through airports. I&#8217;m going to say I succeeded in this one.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Overall I didn&#8217;t do horrible, but it&#8217;s clear that most of goals where I tried to rid myself of bad habits or be more productive were failures. I&#8217;m either setting the bar too high or I&#8217;m not doing enough to maintain accountability with those goals. In any case, I should revisit my strategy. Sometime in the next few days I&#8217;ll post my goals for 2012. I&#8217;m still working on them for right now.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/03/open-source-and-technology-predictions-for-2012/"/>
    <updated>2012-01-03T11:38:44-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/03/open-source-and-technology-predictions-for-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I did for <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2010/">2010</a> and <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">2011</a>, I&#8217;ve created a set of predictions for the coming year around Open Source. However, this year I&#8217;ve expanded it to the general field of technology. These are all fairly specific things that I should be able to verify sometime near the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>SOPA dies a bloody death</strong> - While I don&#8217;t think that Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, and Facebook will enact the <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/12/29/1049815/-Internet-giants-seriously-considering-nuclear-option-to-stop-SOPA">&#8220;Nuclear Option&#8221; for stopping SOPA</a> (largely because of business agreements that Google, Amazon, and Facebook all have with other companies), I do expect that if this horribly misguided bill looks like it will pass that they will do something VERY dramatic. This bill is a critical threat to the internet and freedom because it breaks DNS, makes sites more vulnerable to attacks, and circumvents the judicial process. It must be stopped. Also, <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">Senator Franken, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re my senator, but you&#8217;ve lost my vote and all future support if you continue to support SOPA and PIPA</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy regulations for children under 13 are revisited</strong> - This is a bit of a risky prediction because Congress has enacted hordes of horrible laws under the guise of protecting children. However, as it the internet becomes more important for younger children, it is inevitable that we&#8217;ll need to revisit laws regarding children under 13 using internet services. We can&#8217;t have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/hey-google-thanks-for-making-my-daughter-cry/2011/12/12/gIQAhYx9pO_blog.html">Google go around disabling children&#8217;s accounts</a> when they create <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk">ads showing email accounts for children</a>. Facebook likewise faces similar challenges. Maybe we&#8217;ll finally get the point where we inject common sense and let parents do their job of monitoring their children. Or, probably not. In any case, look for child online privacy to be revisited in the next year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Major automobile software fault</strong> - I drive a pretty bare bones car, but many folks like to have cars with all the bells and whistles. According to an <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/advanced-cars/this-car-runs-on-code">IEEE Spectrum report, premium cars contain more than 100 million lines of code</a>. I know enough about software to know that&#8217;s a problem. Given that automobile manufacturers seek to reuse components within their own brand, or even <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Auto_IWG">with their competitors</a>, and it is rather difficult to upgrade the software on these automobiles, it is only a matter of time before a major fault shows up across an entire brand. Some people may point to Toyota&#8217;s problem with &#8220;unintended acceleration&#8221;, to which I&#8217;ll gently direct to the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/UA">National Highway Transportation Safety Agency&#8217;s final report on unintended acceleration in Toyota automobiles which found no such evidence</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Boxee calls it quits</strong> - Boxee already called it quits on desktop after releasing a completely unusable new version. They&#8217;re facing a mountain of challenges from content providers and hardware manufacturers. The Boxee Box has only been kinda warmly received, and although the <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/live">forthcoming Live TV add on will help</a>, it still only works with ATSC/Clear QAM. Unless they get support for CableCard and recording I don&#8217;t see how Boxee can survive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GNOME falls apart</strong> - <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> has seen better days. Gone are the halcyon days when I used to eagerly await the new release of GNOME in March and September. Now new GNOME releases are more of a &#8220;meh&#8221; thing. With so many things on the web the operating system just doesn&#8217;t matter as much. Combine this with fragmentation among the distros, thanks to Canonical being blockheaded with Unity, and formerly large sponsors dropping away from the project (Maemo, Meego, Tizen, who cares?), and I think that GNOME may reach the breaking point this year. Unfortunately, problems in GNOME will cascade to the rest of the Linux desktop world. By the way, did you hear that 2012 is the year of Linux desktop? Just like it has been every year since I started using the Linux desktop seventeen years ago. Ugh.

<li><strong>Netflix gets acquired and Reed Hastings gets fired</strong> - While there have been companies that have been more mismanaged, Tyco and Enron come to mind, there are few that have messed up so spectacularly without violating any laws. Netflix probably did the right thing in trying to jettison the expensive and dying disc business, but going streaming only, which is the way of the future, leaves them at the mercy of the studios. Netflix will be acquired, most likely by a large network provider without content, such as Verizon. There&#8217;s an off chance that given it&#8217;s current $3B valuation it may get swooped up by private capital, but that seems unlikely as private capital lacks both content and distribution mechanisms. In fact, Netflix going private is almost as unlikely as Reed Hastings finishing the year as CEO of Netflix. Need more evidence for this future? Check out their stock price over the past year:</li>

<li><p><strong>Go gets a killer project</strong> - I think that <a href="http://golang.org/">Go programming language from Google</a> has a lot of interesting concepts that make it nice alternative to the current dominant languages of Java and C#. Unfortunately, it needs a killer project before people will start to use it (similar to Rails and Ruby). My guess is that this is the year that will happen. Expect Google to show off something big and cool at I/O in June that attracts tens of thousands new developers to the platform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Android continues to grow, but not at the expense of iOS</strong> - this will be a continuation of current trends. Both Android and iOS are growing. Pundits say this is at the expense of RIM and Microsoft, but in reality its just that its more people moving from feature phones to smart phones that they use only as phones with nice on screen keyboards. iOS will remain the dominant smartphone platform in terms of mindshare.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Internet political meltdown</strong> - After watching the SOPA hearings live it became clear that most of our politicians don&#8217;t have a clue about how the internet and social media work. Even those who have been bitten by the internet (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=santorum">Googled &#8220;Santorum&#8221; before?</a>) don&#8217;t really understand how poor actions and the genius of a single individual can cause such a huge problem. Expect at least one candidate for Federal office (congress or president) to have a meltdown due to something that happened on the Internet. Of course, some might say this already happened to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_(U.S._politician">George Allen with &#8220;macaca&#8221;</a>#.22Macaca.22_controversy), but I&#8217;m expecting something bigger this year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shakeup at the Free Software Foundation</strong> - Let&#8217;s be perfectly clear: I do not wish ill upon <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">the Free Software Foundation</a> or <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>. They do great things for freedom and I am eternally in their debt. However, the divide between the FSF and the rest of the Open Source world continues to grow. The GPL is no longer the go-to license for new Open Source projects. Their campaigns against DRM and service based systems are negative campaigns. If you want to win people to your side, do something that gets people excited and presents a better alternative. When that happens the FSF will thrive. Unfortunately, the FSF recently has engaged in childish spats around software freedom and when you lower yourself to that level you have to expect that one of your spokepeople will eventually do something massively stupid and cause a major controversy to ensue.</p></li>

<p>So, what do you think? Did I pick a bunch of easy predictions for 2012? What do you think will happen this year?</p>

    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2012/01/02/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new year means that it is time to revisit <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/">the predictions about Open Source and technology in 2011 I made at the end of 2010</a>. As before, I&#8217;ve tried to be entirely honest with my assessment. If I&#8217;ve got something wrong please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll correct it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>On the PC front Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming, although they’ll finally get their act together and make it work well with GPU acceleration. Interfaces for Netflix will all move the route of the PS3 and adopt an HTML based interface.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly true</strong> - Netflix still requires Silverlight, arguably making it the only thing that is keeping Microsoft from killing Silverlight. Apparently the GPU acceleration issue is more due to Silverlight than Netflix, so I can&#8217;t totally fault them there. Although, seriously, Flash and HTML5 both feature GPU acceleration. Most of the interfaces have moved to pure HTML - with the Windows Media Center (developed and supported by Microsoft) and XBox 360 interfaces being notable exceptions. It seems as though Netflix has a Microsoft problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google will meet it’s match and discover that the movie and TV studios really don’t want to work with them and will be forced to pull the plug on Google TV.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly false</strong> - Google TV has had it&#8217;s problems this year. In November, <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/11/logitech-says-google-tv-was-a-big-mistake.html">Logitech, one of the biggest supporters or Google TV said it was a huge mistake</a> and had cost them $300 million. Nonetheless, Google TV soldiers on. Given the reduction in support for Windows Media Center, it seems that if Google TV ever got Live TV and timeshifting support it could be a great product. We&#8217;ll see what Google says at I/O this year, but I highly doubt that Google TV is going the way of the dodo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Although Google will continue to tout the number of Android phones available as a success metric for the project, it will continue to see fragmentation and iPhone will remain the phone to beat.</strong>
<strong>True</strong> - I could be generous and describe Android as a clusterfuck. However, I&#8217;ll let <a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">this chart about long term Android support</a> do all the talking for me. I realize that the chart talks about support, but it&#8217;s one very major piece of many problems in Android.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Despite all of the Android tablets and the upcoming Blackberry Playbook, the iPad will remain dominant and continue to sell more than all the other tablets combined.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I didn&#8217;t anticipate the Kindle Fire, but given that every other tablet has landed with relatively loud thuds I think this is a safe claim. The iPad is still the tablet to beat in the market. There are tablets that are faster and have more features, but they&#8217;re still chasing the iPad.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RIM will introduce a new OS for their phones based on the Playbook’s OS. The OS will be open sourced but will fail to attract any sort of market movement.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - <a href="http://techland.time.com/2011/12/07/poor-rim-renames-bbx-blackberry-10-due-to-trademark-woes/">RIM introduced BBX, later renamed Blackberry 10</a>. RIM does provide <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/18/research-in-motion-announces-bbx-combines-the-best-of-blackber/">over 100 Open Source libraries for Blackberry 10</a>, but the core operating system is not Open Source.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chromium OS from Google will land like a lead balloon. Initial reviews of the device will be severely hampered by the inability to access many services without Internet access.</strong><br/>
<strong>True</strong> - I travel a lot. I see lots of people with lots of gadgets. I&#8217;ve never seen someone with a Chromebook. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/samsung-chromebook-series-5-review/">Early reviews of Chromebooks were less than glowing</a>. I don&#8217;t recall seeing any big push for Chromebooks for the holidays. I&#8217;m open to evidence to the contrary.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The browser wars will continue to heat up (hello, 1998!). Firefox’s market share will remain relatively stagnant while Chrome’s market share grows. This stagnation will result in some shakeups at Mozilla as they attempt to re-evaluate the market landscape. This will eventually lead to a new and lighter desktop browser based off Firefox.</strong><br/>
<strong>Half True</strong> - Chrome has continued to gain market share and Firefox has fallen off. However, Mozilla has not experienced any major shakeup. Rather they&#8217;ve become more focused on their core purpose of delivering an open web. It seems as though the browser is secondary, which is probably a good thing overall.
<img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2012/01/StatCounter-browser-ww-monthly-201012-201112.png"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Source hardware outside of Android will generally continue to falter. This includes OLPC and the Boxee Box (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>Kinda True</strong> - Although Boxee is doing better than I would have expected it seems as though the only Open Source consumer hardware people talk about is Android based. I am, however, only marking this as kinda true because the variety of Open Source hardware available for the maker community (arduinos, rep raps, maker bots, lasersaurs, etc), is staggering. I was referring to consumer hardware in the original prediction, but I wasn&#8217;t specific enough to call this completely true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We’ll see the first lawsuit regarding ownership of code in an Open Source project after the code of an original author has been patched out and the project license changed (re-run from last year).</strong><br/>
<strong>False</strong> - I haven&#8217;t seen anything like this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apache will have a significant long term shakeup regarding their relationship with Java. I’d imagine that this means that the Java projects are jettisoned into a new foundation.</strong><br/>
<strong>Mostly False</strong> - Although Apache has taken it&#8217;s hits this year, mainly because of it being lured into Oracle&#8217;s anti-community trap related to OpenOffice.org, there hasn&#8217;t been a major shakeup.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Total score: 3 completely true, one mostly true, two half true, one kinda true. Assigning point values of 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 for each of those categories, my total score is 5. About 50% of a perfect score, although I had some element of truth to 7 out of 10 of my predictions. Not bad, we&#8217;ll see how my career as a pundit progresses in 2012.</p>

    <updated>2011-11-10T15:12:40-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/11/10/guilt-motivation-and-procrastination</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve had trouble doing anything more than idly browsing the Internet during my non-work hours. Yes, they&#8217;re non-work hours, but I still like that time to be productive. I feel much better after work if I took those few hours and wrote some code than if I just sat around and browsed Reddit all evening. I&#8217;d imagine that the same holds true for most readers of this blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not above using technological gimmicks to keep me from wasting time. While <a href="http://macfreedom.com/">Freedom</a> works great for writers and work situations when everything is on your computer, it&#8217;s not so great for developers who need to read documentation or integrate with other web services. Instead, I&#8217;ve been using browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd</a> to limit the amount of time I can waste during a day or evening on social sites. These tools allow you to configure a set of sites to block after a certain time limit. For example, I now give myself a combined 30 minutes per day between the hours of Midnight and 9:30pm to use most social sites and news sites. It&#8217;s done wonders for my productivity at home.</p>

<p>However, I did notice one interesting thing. The default in StayFocusd is to give 10 minutes a day total. This doesn&#8217;t work because I browse these sites over breakfast each day. Thus, I needed to update my time limit to 30 minutes. I was presented with the following series of dialogs:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd1.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd2.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/11/StayFocusd3.png"></p>

<p>Although these messages, which all occur as the result of increasing the allotted time on procrastination sites, seem trite, they kinda work. Even the kitten one. Sure, I know there is no kitten given electroshock therapy as a result of my actions, but it does allow me to consider my actions more. In fact, it got me to consider my actions much more than a simple one stage dialog box would have. If it would have been plain writing I don&#8217;t think it would have worked as well, but the guilt of the hypothetical chicken did it to me.</p>

<p>This got me thinking, what if other poor behaviors had similar warnings. A pack of Starburst, to which I am woefully addicted, could read &#8220;Warning: these will add extra pounds to your frame and mess up your running&#8221; or hitting the snooze on my phone could activate a voice that says &#8220;These last five minutes won&#8217;t make you feel any better. Use those five minutes to make a cup of coffee instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Any other thoughts on interesting ways to motivate people using technology?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I attended the joint meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference and the Foundations of Software Engineering Conference earlier this month in Szeged, Hungary. I was fortunate enough to have a paper in the 4th Workshop on Social Software Engineering and also in the main conference.</p>

<h3>Engineering Software Engineering Teams</h3>

<p>This is a short little paper that I wrote based on some observations regarding how software engineering teams share information and coordinate. In short, economics says there are two different models of sharing information &#8211; top down (Keynesian) or bottom up (Austrian). However, as we know, neither is 100% correct. We need to flow information up from the bottom and down from the top. However, simply flowing the information up or down doesn&#8217;t do us much good because the information won&#8217;t get where it is needed. We&#8217;ve noticed that most projects have someone who acts as an intercessor for communications, now we just need to find them.</p>

<p>P. Wagstrom, “Engineering Software Engineering Teams,” in Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Social Software Engineering, Szeged, Hungary, 2011.

<h3>The Onion Patch: Migration in Open Source Ecosystems</h3>

<p>A longer paper written with Corey Jergensen and Anita Sarma at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. We analyzed several projects within my large <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/research/gnome">GNOME data set</a> to understand how users actually join a project and how it might expand into an ecosystem. We found that the basic socialization pattern of email, bugs, then code is rarely found on individual projects. Rather, it&#8217;s much more common to find it across the ecosystem. We also identify several ways that individuals can apply shared knowledge across projects in the ecosystem.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/09/22/graph-databases-and-revision-history/"/>
    <updated>2011-09-22T19:34:54-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/09/22/graph-databases-and-revision-history</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Graph databases such as <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a>, <a href="http://www.orientechnologies.com/orient-db.htm">OrientDB</a>, and <a href="http://www.infinitegraph.com/">InifiniteGraph</a> are useful tools for social science researchers because localized queries are a function of only the number of links relative to the nodes in question. In contrast, relational databases, such as <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, suffer performance degradation as more nodes are added because of the number of entries in join tables and the computational difficulty of finding the relevant edges in the indexes.</p>

<p>For my own research I&#8217;ve been exploring some issues around Open Source software development and Twitter using graph databases, and thus far it&#8217;s been very interesting. However, one thing that I haven&#8217;t yet found is an easy way to maintain version history for nodes and edges. In this entry I discuss a strategy that I&#8217;ve found to be effective for managing revisions of items with a small number of links.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume that you have a system such as a corporate directory where each user has a set of skills that they can self-declare. For example, there may be a user who identifies himself as being an expert in LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python. This can be represented as a very simple graph:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision1.png">
        <figcaption>Simple network showing relation between a user and his declared skills </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This works very well if the only source of data about skills is the user. However, in reality information about a users skills can be obtained from a variety of other resources such as project and work item assignment, natural language processing or artifacts (tweets, email, etc), or surveys of other employees within the company. If that&#8217;s the case we&#8217;ll want to break the source of set of skills into a new node and link it to the user.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision2.png">
        <figcaption>Connection between a user and his skills with an intermediary node to identify the source of the skills </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>If we had multiple sources we&#8217;d just have multiple nodes similar to the cyan node labeled &#8220;User1Skills&#8221; in the diagram above. However, what happens if the user is no longer interested in Python and Apache and instead has concluded that listing Ruby is a better option for his skills? How do we store his updated set of skills? The simplest thing to do is to only look at the current set of skills and loose the data from the previous set of skills.</p>

<p>But that may not be ideal because there&#8217;s a chance that at some point previous states could be very important. For example, what if there was another user, User2, who wrote some critical Python code then later left the company? User1 may be the only person who ever had experience with Python and throwing away this previous state may prove costly. Instead what we can do is to create a new User1Skills node and connect it to User1 with the same CURRENT_SKILLS edge, but also connect it to the previous User1Skills node with an edge labeled PREVIOUS_STATE.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision3.png">
        <figcaption>Managing a single previous state of User1&#8217;s skill set as shown by the PREVIOUS_STATE edge linking to the older state </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This can be easily expanded when to include multiple previous states but creating new User1Skills nodes, linking it to the appropriate skills, changing the destination of the CURRENT_SKILLS link and creating a new PREVIOUS_STATE link to the old state. The advantage is that this method is essentially constant time for the number of previous states as we&#8217;re just rewiring a couple of different nodes.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/09/GraphRevision4.png">
        <figcaption>Multiple PREVIOUS_STATE edges and nodes can be used to indicate that there are many previous states for this user. Additions of previous states are done in constant time. </figcaption>
    </figure>


<h3>Querying the Graph</h3>

<p>We can continue like this ad infinitum for whenever we get an update of new skills. However at some point we&#8217;ll need to actually traverse this graph to make use of this historic skill sets of individuals in the network. I&#8217;ll talk about three different types of queries: listing all the current skills in the organization, listing User1&#8217;s skills at an arbitrary time in the past, and taking a skill that is not a current skill for any user and figuring out which user had the skill in the past.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll demonstrate the queries using <a href="https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin">Gremlin</a>, a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> based domain specific language for graph traversals. If you&#8217;d like to play along at home, I&#8217;ve made the previous figure available as <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/misc/revisions.graphml">a GraphML file that you can download</a>.</p>

<p>First, lets get started by firing up Gremlin and loading the GraphML file in to the Gremlin REPL.</p>

<h4>Listing All Current Skills in the Organization</h4>

<p>There are two ways to traverse to get all of the currently active skill nodes. Either we can start with each person, follow the CURRENT_SKILLS link and then SKILLS link, or we can can start with each skill and traverse backwards.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Starting from the skills themselves requires a bit more logic as we&#8217;ll end up with multiple paths to a person. We take advantage of Gremlin&#8217;s ability to backtrack here and get the information about the actual skills.</p>

<h4>Listing User1&#8217;s Skills in the Past</h4>

<p>To list all of User1&#8217;s skills at some point in the past we can first need to store when the skill sets were collected. I use a property called timestamp that includes a simple unix timestamp for when the data was collected. Within Groovy (and thus Gremlin), you can get a timestamp for a date using the following bit of code:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Within our the data set I&#8217;ve set the timestamp field of the SKILLSET nodes to be midnight UTC on January 1, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. We can pick a date and then execute the query to get the users skill set as of that date. However, this query is a little messy and needs to utilize the <a href="http://tinkerpop.com/maven2/com/tinkerpop/pipes/0.7/api/com/tinkerpop/pipes/branch/IfThenElsePipe.html">ifThenElse pipe</a> within Gremlin. The reason is because what we really need is a while loop, and the loop mechanism in Gremlin is a do loop.</p>

<h4>Finding out Which User&#8217;s Currently Have the Skill or Had it in the Past</h4>

<p>In this example we&#8217;ll traverse the graph to find the users who at one point in time had the Python skill. As before, because Gremlin only has a do loop and not a while loop, we need to do the crazy ifThenElse condition to check the initial condition. By artfully removing the ifThenElse we can eliminate the condition when a user currently has the skill and only list users who had the skill appear in a previous update.</p>

<h3>Drawbacks and Limitations to the Method</h3>

<p>There are some notable drawbacks to this method. The most notable and obvious is how messy some of these graph traversals are because of the need to use ifThenElse pipes. Fortunately, after pinging people on the Gremlin list it seems as though they&#8217;re amenable to creating different types of pipes include a while pipe.</p>

<p>The other issue is that this mechanism doesn&#8217;t work well for a situation such as <a href="http:/www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. In a system like Twitter where each user can have hundreds or thousands outgoing links this will create a huge number of extra edges that aren&#8217;t actually active but slow down the traversals. Perhaps a better way to handle these links is to add properties to the edges that indicate when the edge was added or removed. I&#8217;ll try to address these in a future post.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions for how to handle revisions in a graph database? Leave them here and maybe we can up with a great solution.</p>

    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/09/18/observations-on-the-air-france-a380-and-its-in-flight-entertainment-system</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to being a computer science nerd and a part-time policy wonk, I&#8217;m also a bit of a commercial aviation nut and, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk">Louis CK, I think flying is pretty amazing</a>. This year I&#8217;m on track to take about 75 flights, mainly in the United States, but a few flights to Europe and Asia. For the last two years every one of my flights has been on a <a href="http://www.skyteam.com/">SkyTeam</a> carrier. This isn&#8217;t so much because I think they have the best routes or best frequent flier program, in fact, I&#8217;m pretty sure that <a href="http://www.delta.com/">Delta</a>&#8217;s miles are nearly worthless unless used on partner carriers, but more because of the fact that I often fly into one of Delta&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_hub#Fortress_hub">fortress hubs</a> and upgrades make travel nicer.</p>

<p>I spent the last two weeks in Europe where I attended the combination meeting of the <a href="http://2011.esec-fse.org/">European Software Engineering Conference and the Foundations of Software Engineering</a> conference in Szeged, Hungary. My original intention was to take Delta directly into Budapest as they offered double miles from JFK, unfortunately, Delta terminated this flight at the end of August, leaving me with the choice between transferring with <a href="http://www.klm.com/">KLM</a> in Amsterdam or <a href="http://www.airfrance.com/">Air France</a> in Paris (technically, <a href="http://www.alitalia.com/">Alitalia</a> also serves this route, but I&#8217;ve never seen their flights in searches for anything but flights to Italy). Price wise the flights through either Paris or Amsterdam were about the same. Normally this would make it an easy decision to transfer in Amsterdam as Paris is horribly laid out, takes forever to transfer in, most of the lounges are outside security, and the thick French accent on the announcements makes them more difficult to understand than even announcements in Chinese airports. Yet I chose to transfer there for four reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I had never flown Air France before, so this could be a new experience.</li>
<li>The French are far too sensible to force Backscatter X-Ray or Millimeter Wave machines (aka Porno Scanners) on their passengers.</li>
<li>Unlike the rest of Europe, the Paris airport has drinking fountains. Not as many as a US airport, but enough so you can get some water.</li>
<li>Air France flies the Airbus A380 on the CDG-JFK route once a day.</li>
</ol>


<p>Applying a little flexibility to my travel schedule I was able to get a ticket on the A380. The nerd in me was excited. I&#8217;ve seen the A380 at numerous airports around the world, this would be my chance to ride in one. However, because it was Air France and work only pays for coach I had no hope of an upgrade and wouldn&#8217;t get the premium experience. Furthermore, when I booked the ticket the agent could not get me a seat on the upper deck. Le sigh.</p>

<p>First impression on taking my seat: this thing is ENORMOUS. The planes center or curvature was at the same level as my head, making the walls of the plane bow out from the window seats. The inside was absolutely cavernous. The 747 Transcon is actually a little bit longer than the A380, but the wingspan of the A380 is more than 10m wider (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Giant_planes_comparison.svg">79.8m vs 68.5m</a>). In Addition to the wings being longer, they&#8217;re also wider. Together with a better shape and newer material this made the A380 the quietest plane I think I&#8217;ve ever been on.</p>

    </figure>


<p>The A380 also has one of the nicest in flight entertainment systems that I&#8217;ve used. I didn&#8217;t bother to count, but there seemed to be about 80 different movies and a similar number of television shows. It also did some really interesting things like show a view of the tail camera when taking off and landing, which I thought was one of the coolest things ever:</p>

<p>Once we hit about 10,000 feet the system was turned on. It is a combination of a touch screen and removable controller. From the looks of it most people were just using the touch screen. The controller was used for playing games and supposedly allowed you to make calls to the ground. I relaxed and started to watch some movies.</p>

<p>About halfway through my second movie the system for the girl sitting next to me stopped working. She had support for menus but couldn&#8217;t play anything anymore. I started to notice that other people were experiencing a similar phenomenon: either the were stuck on menus, or worse, had crashed out to a white screen. At the end of my second movie I was able to start a third, but my curiosity had taken hold, so I started to play around, and shortly thereafter my screen crashed too.</p>

  <figure class='center'>

        <figcaption>Crashed A380 In-Flight Entertainment System </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>The astute reader will notice that this appears to be nothing more than a bunch of PHP error messages. It&#8217;s clear that there is a client server architecture and that the menus are nothing more than a bunch of HTML rendered in a web browser. It&#8217;s also painfully clear what the problem is &#8211; the server for this block of seats had reverted to a read-only file system, and unfortunately one of the scripts was having problems with this. There&#8217;s a variety of other pieces of information we can get from this too. For example my IFE&#8217;s IP address was 172.17.64.59, the system was developed by a division of <a href="http://www.thalesgroup.com/">Thales Group</a> &#8211; a large aerospace firm, this is the Air France customized version 2.50 of the passenger GUI, and that the utils.php file has at least 294 lines in it.</p>

<p>This called for more exploration, so I touched the screen on one of the spots where function.fopen was highlighted, and much to my surprise it worked. I was in a normal web browser. I pulled out the remote and hit the backspace key used for text messaging and it put me on the previous page. Things were getting interesting.</p>

        <figcaption>One Should Never See This Screen </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>This provided a few more pieces of information about their infrastructure. The main server was running a very outdated version of Apache on a Fedora server that thought it was host d4p1-v133. It also shows that testing standards in this part of Thales were quite poor if I was easily able to get here. The next step was to see if I could get further using the keypad. I took out the handset and began to mash buttons in an attempt to get something that might let me bring up a URL bar. The backspace button worked and moved me back to the previous page. Sadly, the handset had a shift key, but lacked ctrl, alt, and all the function keys that would let me jump there. There was, however a USB port. Most people were using the USB port to charge iPhones. I decided to stick a USB stick in. A screen popped up saying that USB was initialized, but that&#8217;s all it could do. It would be nice if it provided an option to play my media on the stick. Later in the flight I learned that this was because you could purchase some content and download it to your stick.</p>

<p>I also conducted a physical examination of the device. The display itself is about one inch thick with an additional inch of a plastic shielding behind it. This shielding allows for air circulation and also makes it really hard to get at any ports the machine has. Luckily, I have very long and slender fingers and found that there is a single wire entering the machine from the seat that must contain power and network - no luck for surreptitiously jacking into their network. At this point I&#8217;m pretty sure that I was starting to spook out the young French girl on her way to an English school in California sitting next to me, so I ceased with the physical examination. The flight attendants also had enough complaints about the broken system that they made an announcement that they were trying to fix the situation. It was only the IFE units in our section (about 50 seats) that died. Given that there are about 500 seats on the Air France A380, there must be around 10 servers powering IFE.</p>

<p>The flight attendants tried a couple of times to reboot our IFE units from a master control panel somewhere on the plane. Each time the screens would go black with a single blinking cursor in the upper right corner. Then depending on the state of the client when the server went read only you&#8217;d either get un-navigable menus or the error screens like I had. I was actually quite surprised that I didn&#8217;t see a penguin on bootup, but I&#8217;m pretty sure these units were Thales TopSeries units, which means they&#8217;re Linux based. I wanted to explain that it was a problem with the server, but if was probably not worth my time and frankly, after having that stupid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_Security_Screening_Selection">SSSS on my boarding passes</a> for four years in the middle of the last decade, I should try to play nice in the sky.</p>

<p>Overall I can draw a couple of conclusions from this:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m not certain why any writing should be done to support a client that is, for the most part, only reading media. This smells of bad design, architecture, or implementation. Probably a combination of all three.</li>
<li>The error screens should have never been shown to users. Even when a system is horribly broken there are ways to make it show an error screen that would say something like &#8220;The IFE System is Curently Unavailable&#8221;.</li>
<li> Next time I fly an A380 I&#8217;m bringing along some other USB gadgets such as a USB keyboard, USB mouse, and USB ethernet dongle. Given the errors that I observed I&#8217;m 90% certain that plugging in a keyboard and hitting Alt-F1 (or Ctrl-Alt-F1) would drop you to a console. From there it would be relatively easy to poke around more and see if the media are using some sort of DRM, which I doubt they are.</li>
</ol>


<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m not going to fly on the A380 again anytime soon. I don&#8217;t have any upcoming trips to Europe or Asia, but if one of my readers cares to poke around and report back I&#8217;d be thankful.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 9/19/2011 09:14 EDT</strong>: The excellent folks behind the <a href="http://twitter.com/nycaviation">@nycaviation</a> twitter account helpfully pointed out that <a href="http://twitter.com/runwaygirl">@runwaygirl</a> <a href="http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/11/05/334471/thales-details-ife-offering-on-air-frances-new-a380.html">detailed the AF A380 IFE system and confirmed it is Thales TopSeries</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/05/10/raid-1-performance-on-windows-7/"/>
    <updated>2011-05-10T19:44:56-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/05/10/raid-1-performance-on-windows-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I ditched Ubuntu and MythTV on my media center box for Windows 7 Ultimate. To be honest one of the main reasons I did this was for NetFlix, but also because I got tired of having to tweak my media center all the time and Windows 7 Media Center just works. Also Windows 7 is smart enough to know how to sleep and wake up from sleep, saving my lots of money over the course of a year.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that I never lose any episodes of high quality television programs, I keep my boot and recorded television programs on a Raid 1 (mirror) set of 2 TB drives. Because all of the data is copied across two different drives in theory it have higher speed reads than a single drive, but lets take a look. I admit this isn&#8217;t the most intelligent of tests, as it&#8217;s simply done using ATTO Disk Benchmark. First, the results for an individual 2TB Samsung drive:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/05/Independent_Overlapped_0.5_to_8192_1GB.png">
        <figcaption>Performance for a single 2TB drive </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Next, the performance for a pair of 2TB Samsung drives working in a RAID-1 mirror set:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/05/Mirrored_Overlapped_0.5_to_8192_1GB.png">
        <figcaption>Performance for a mirrored pair of 2TB drives </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>As we see, there is very little difference between the two. In almost all cases the two setups are within about 10% of each other. There clearly is no intelligence in Windows 7 for spreading reads across multiple drives. One of the major side effects of setting up a RAID 1 is that when something goes wrong you&#8217;ll need to rebuild your mirror. Unfortunately, this seems to happen much more often would be desirable and it often renders the machine nearly unusable. However, contrary to my suspicions, this has nothing to do with massively decreased disk performance:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2011/05/Resynching_Overlapped_0.5_to_8192_1GB.png">
        <figcaption>Performance of mirrored 2TB drives while resynching </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>I have no idea what the spike in the middle is for. It&#8217;s clear, however, that the reason for the system bogging down is not because of decreased drive performance but rather because of other issues. This might be CPU related as my media center box is running on a very old AMD Athlon64x2 4400+ on a motherboard that is almost six years old. So, the resynching problems might be because of CPU issues, or it could be because of something else (perhaps CrashPlan is doing something weird). I really have no idea right now.</p>

<p>While I was benchmarking I also decided to benchmark my 1st generation USB drobo with 2x1TB and 2x2TB drives in it. You can see where this going. Performance is atrocious. Glad I use it for backup storage and videos.</p>

  <figure class='center'>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/04/18/guilty-pleasures/"/>
    <updated>2011-04-18T19:05:59-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/04/18/guilty-pleasures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m 32, married, a professional scientist, and I have a confession to make. I play video games. Worse, I feel guilty about playing games. I often feel so guilty that it saps much of the guy from the game, turning it into some perverse drudgery where I feel obligated to keep on playing so I can say I actually beat the game. In other words, the guilt that I get from playing video games is so great that it turns every game into an <a href="http://majicjungle.com/blog/261/">obligation game like Farmville</a>.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s always this way with games. I can sit down and play Hydro Thunder for 15 minutes after work and enjoy it. Until I realize that I should be doing something else, like <a href="http://twentysixandtwo.wordpress.com/">training for a marathon</a>, reading a paper, or writing some code.  What&#8217;s interesting is that nowhere in that list of alternative things is something that is related to family. It could be because I don&#8217;t live with my wife right now and I don&#8217;t have kids. But I believe it&#8217;s a symptom of something else.</p>

<p>Between my masters and doctorate degrees I spent a little over seven years in graduate school. Seven years in which every waking moment was supposed to be optimized for work. Now, I admit that I didn&#8217;t do that. In fact, I had one hell of time during graduate school. It was a hell of a lot of fun. However, graduate school has no concept of work life balance. There always
is more work you can be doing. You know that there is always some paper you should be reading or writing, a presentation that could be created, or a new skill to be obtained. Even if your advisor doesn&#8217;t drill that into your head (and thankfully I had amazing advisors) there are always other students who do.</p>

<p>Of course, it should have gotten better after grad school, but then I left to work for a company that gave up on the concept of work life balance and now talks about work life integration. This is largely a side effect of working with people all over the world. Phone calls from 9-11pm with China are hardly unusual. Nor is a 7:30am meeting with Israel. On the plus side I get the
flexibility I need to travel and can sleep in on days when I don&#8217;t have early morning meetings, but it still remains that during my waking hours I always have a sense of guilt about things I should be doing. In turn this guilt ends up sapping the fun away from things that should be fun.</p>

<p>The question that I need to answer is this, which is the correct behavior? Believing that video games are fun? Realizing there is always more to do? Or perhaps some other choice?</p>

    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2011/01/01/2011-personal-development-goals</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I hate the concept of New Year&#8217;s Resolutions with an utter passion. It&#8217;s arbitrary for people to pick a single day and decide to change everything. Some people might call these resolutions, I call these personal development goals.  None of these are dramatic changes from things that I already do, or should be doing. Rather, this set of goals will help keep me on track for 2011.</p>

<h3>Academic</h3>

<ul>
<li>Submit papers to FSE, CSCW, and ICSE</li>
<li>Submit at least one journal paper</li>
</ul>


<h3>Physical</h3>

<p>These and a few more are covered in <a href="http://twentysixandtwo.wordpress.com/2010/12/31/running-goals-for-2011-looking-forward/">a post about 2011 goals on my marathon blog</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a mile in under 5:50</li>
<li>Run a marathon in under 3:50</li>
<li>Bench press my own weight</li>
<li>Get down to 170 lbs</li>
<li>Barefoot/Vibram race of 10k or more</li>
<li>Run to and from work at least five times</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li>Release a new and interesting Open Source project</li>
<li>Visit a new country</li>
<li>Read two &#8221;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml">Classics</a>&#8221;</li>
<li>Win at least two of my existing video games before buying any new ones</li>
<li>Spend less than $60 at the cafeteria at work</li>
<li>Do four &#8220;10 day trials&#8221;</li>
<li><del>Cook Creme Brulee</del> - accomplished on 12/27/2010. That&#8217;s what getting a Creme Brulee torch for Christmas will do for you.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking Bad Habits</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only 12 sodas in the year</li>
<li>Only 6 packs of Starburst in the year</li>
<li>Only 3 visits to McDonalds in the year</li>
</ul>


<p>The most annoying thing about setting such personal development goals is that I haven&#8217;t been able to find a good tool to track these goals.  If anyone knows of one feel free to post it in the comments.  I&#8217;ll revisit these goals at the end of the 2011 calendar year.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-31T20:00:36-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following on the heels of my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010/">somewhat successful predictions regarding Open Source for 2010</a>, I now my present my 10 predictions for Open Source in 2011.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the PC front Netflix will continue to require Silverlight for streaming, although they&#8217;ll finally get their act together and make it work well with GPU acceleration. Interfaces for Netflix will all move the route of the PS3 and adopt an HTML based interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Google will meet it&#8217;s match and discover that the movie and TV studios really don&#8217;t want to work with them and will be forced to pull the plug on Google TV.</p></li>
<li><p>Although Google will continue to tout the number of Android phones available as a success metric for the project, it will continue to see fragmentation and iPhone will remain the phone to beat.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite all of the Android tablets and the upcoming Blackberry Playbook, the iPad will remain dominant and continue to sell more than all the other tablets combined.</p></li>
<li><p>RIM will introduce a new OS for their phones based on the Playbook&#8217;s OS. The OS will be open sourced but will fail to attract any sort of market movement.</p></li>
<li><p>Chromium OS from Google will land like a lead balloon.  Initial reviews of the device will be severely hampered by the inability to access many services without Internet access.</p></li>
<li><p>The browser wars will continue to heat up (hello, 1998!). Firefox&#8217;s market share will remain relatively stagnant while Chrome&#8217;s market share grows. This stagnation will result in some shakeups at Mozilla as they attempt to re-evaluate the market landscape.  This will eventually lead to a new and lighter desktop browser based off Firefox.</p></li>
<li><p>Open Source hardware outside of Android will generally continue to falter. This includes OLPC and the Boxee Box (re-run from last year).</p></li>
<li><p>We&#8217;ll see the first lawsuit regarding ownership of code in an Open Source project after the code of an original author has been patched out and the project license changed (re-run from last year).</p></li>
<li><p>Apache will have a significant long term shakeup regarding their relationship with Java.  I&#8217;d imagine that this means that the Java projects are jettisoned into a new foundation.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>There are a few predictions in this list that are rather ambitious - particularly the creation of a new browser from Mozilla and pulling the plug on Google TV. I was at least partially right on 5/10 predictions last year, I&#8217;m feeling a little more confident this year and saying that I&#8217;ll get 6 correct this year, making me correct more often then not.</p>

<p>What at your thoughts on these predictions?  Too much? Too easy?</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010/"/>
    <updated>2010-12-31T12:00:46-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/12/31/a-review-of-open-source-predictions-for-2010</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As 2009 came to a close and 2010 started I decided to put all of my schooling and research to good use and attempt some short term prognostication. I entered the realm of people making predictions for 2010. Here&#8217;s a recap of <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/12/31/open-source-predictions-for-2010/">my predictions for 2010</a> and how everything shook out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Foundation</a> will undergo a major upheaval related to community/corporate structure and governance.</strong><br/>
Wrong - As near as I can tell there was no upheaval in the Eclipse Foundation.  The Foundation continues to grow and release some really high quality software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Highly customized hardware running on Open Source will continue to under-perform, particularly OLPC and Litl</strong><br/>
Correct - OLPC stayed relatively out of the news this last year.  Most of the talk has focused around the XO-3 that is expected to be revealed at CES 2011. The biggest news that I remember seeing about OLPC is that the display technology was available from Pixel Qi and you could hack it into your netbook.  Very cool, but not what OLPC set out to do.  As for Litl, the only real time I heard about them over the past year was when they sponsored elements of the Boston GNOME Summit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Netflix on Linux</strong><br/>
Correct - This was almost too easy. Next year I&#8217;ll predict that Mac users are smug.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Boxee Box will underperform</strong><br/>
Correct - The Boxee Box was delayed because of a switch to an Intel architecture, a decision that makes it very similar to a Google TV device. Complete with the drawbacks of content blocking.  However, somewhat orthogonal, it appears that HTPC and embedded attached devices are still a niche market. Apple made some nice inroads with the new version of Apple TV, but that&#8217;s not open source. Given the tepid reviews of the Boxee Box, I&#8217;d say this was Correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google will suffer a major privacy problem and be quiet about it</strong><br/>
Mostly Correct - Google did have a bit of a privacy leak, but not quite in the way that I thought.  Google Buzz proved to be a privacy disaster for them and it took them a while to respond.  They were eventually <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/google-settles-suit-over-buzz-and-privacy/">sued over buzz and lost, but no compensation was due to users</a>. I&#8217;d say that I&#8217;m 75% correct on this one, I&#8217;m taking off some because they did respond.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A major Open Source community will disassociate itself from the Free Software Foundation</strong><br/>
Wrong - I don&#8217;t recall any major Open Source community attempting to disassociate itself from the FSF.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GNOME&#8217;s reliance on commercial firms will cause a schism and no one will care about GNOME in tablets and phones</strong><br/>
Half Correct - This prediction was sloppy and really should have been two different predictions. It still appears that very few people care about MAEMO/MeeGo.  The Nokia N8 is a niche device that even ubernerds tend to eschew. This doesn&#8217;t appear to have caused many problems for GNOME, however. Therefore, right on one, wrong on another.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ubuntu will remove at least one major application and direct users to the cloud.</strong><br/>
Wrong - Nothing of the sort happened.  In retrospect this was a foolish prediction given how Ubuntu pushes itself for rural communities which may have poor network access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rights of Open Source authors will be challenged as a project evolves and code from the original authors no longer exists.</strong><br/>
Wrong - I searched and couldn&#8217;t find any example of such a scenario when the original code from an author has been entirely removed and the license changed. Maybe this is too much of a stretch, or maybe it just didn&#8217;t make enough news.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>At least one major project will transition from the GPL to a more business friendly license</strong><br/>
Wrong - Although every year a handful of smaller projects switch licenses, I don&#8217;t remember seeing any major projects switch from the GPL to a more business friendly license.  If anything, major GPL projects seem to have become stronger in their defense of the GPL (e.g. Wordpress).</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Total score: 3 correct, 1 75% correct, 1 50% correct, 5 wrong. That means five of these came partially true, but if we just add the values, we get 4.25, which means that I wasn&#8217;t a golden prognosticator of Open Source for 2010.  However, on the bright side, at least I was able to test my predictions, <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/ray-kurzweils-slippery-futurism">unlike Kurzweil</a>, right?</p>

<p>Coming soon I&#8217;ll post my predictions for 2011.  I&#8217;ve learned a little from this analysis and hope to use that knowledge to make some better future predictions.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/11/24/do-the-tsa-new-ait-body-scanners-hurt-more-than-they-help/"/>
    <updated>2010-11-24T13:57:03-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/11/24/do-the-tsa-new-ait-body-scanners-hurt-more-than-they-help</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Important</h2>

<p>This report and analysis is still in the draft stage.  I&#8217;m open to new data, criticisms about my model, grammatical/writing fixes, and suggestions about how to make it better. There are three ways to leave me feedback.  You can leave a comment at the end of this post, post a comment on this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OperationGrabAss/comments/eb8s3/hi_reddit_i_did_the_math_and_found_that_tsa/">thread on Reddit</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01d_KRRG_6LhPRiTD9fC4Tjw==&amp;c=MyGA9SW3_9oN5pJPqJPrpR55FWn40q7KpXUM4MUHXoY=">email me directly</a>.</p>

<h2>Pending Improvements</h2>

<p>Thanks to everyone on Reddit, Facebook, and folks in the comments who provided useful feedback.  Here&#8217;s a preliminary list of items that I&#8217;ll address in a revision:</p>

<ul>
<li>Better display of graphs: On the cumulative probability graphs, draw some light lines to show the 10/90 window and the median so individuals are better able to see where these values actually lie.  Also, present an additional graph that shows the distribution of all events to make it obvious what the most likely outcome is.</li>
<li>Non-Normality of Terrorist Attacks: Using the expected value for terrorist attacks is somewhat misleading.  A single successful attack can kill hundreds of people.  Instead, I&#8217;ll write some code to do event based modeling with four different scenarios: 1) Destruction of a cargo airliner (minimal fatalities), 2) Partial destruction of an aircraft (along the lines of a minor/major explosive decompression, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloha_Airlines_Flight_243">Aloha Airlines flight 243</a>, 3) Complete destruction of a medium - large jet with total loss of life, 4) Major event with multiple cascading destruction and significant ground fatalities.</li>
<li>Driving vs Flying: I probably over-estimated the number of people opting to drive &#8211; it&#8217;s clear that the general public doesn&#8217;t see these things as a major issue (at least that&#8217;s the TSA said, of course, many AIT scanners were off on the day before Thanksgiving).  More likely this should be between 0.25% and 1.0%.  The length of trips should also be better modeled to something like a triangular distribution between with low, most common, and high values of 200, 400, and 700 miles respectively. Even with these numbers, the story will most likely remain the same, the scanners are scaring people away from a safer form of transit in favor of a riskier one.</li>
<li>Subtraction of Other Risks for Drivers: Drivers have slightly lower risk in some areas than flyers, largely because of no radiation exposure at altitude and no risk of non-violent passenger incidents. It&#8217;s going to make a small difference, but should be included for intellectual honesty.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Executive Summary</h1>

<p>The deployment by the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> of advanced imaging technology (AIT) consisting of backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave detection devices when combined with the new enhanced pat-down procedures has the potential to reduce violent passenger incidents (aka, terrorist attacks on airplanes).  Given the current deployment levels of AIT scanners, these scanners will over a long time horizon only save approximately 2.4 lives a year, while inducing 3.4 incidents of fatal cancer per year over the same period.  Even more troubling is the increase in fatalities as people choose to drive when faced with the possible option of an intrusive enhanced pat-down, which can result in a median of 189 additional roadway fatalities a year.  All together this means that while the AIT program reduces the incidence of a low likelihood,  high risk and high profile terrorist attack, it induces a median of 190.7 deaths across other parts of American society.  Based on this data alone, the AIT will never be able to save more lives than it costs and the program should be considered a failure and stopped immediately.</p>

<h1>Introduction and Background</h1>

<p>The last few weeks has seen absolute uproar over the new TSA advanced imaging technology (AIT) body scanners. In a nutshell, these devices, which utilize two different technologies allow TSA screeners to see underneath a persons clothing without the need for them to actually remove their clothing.  In fact, as we&#8217;ve seen, trying to be helpful to the TSA and <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/nov/21/gun-crusader-strips-down-shorts-hauled-out-san-die/">removing your clothing is grounds for arrest</a> (or being told to <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/11/21/my-tsa-stripdown-vid.html">put on a jacket if you&#8217;re a porn star</a>). Concern over these devices comes in multiple different forms: privacy over the use of the images, radiation exposure from backscatter x-ray scanners, and concern over the invasiveness of the new enhanced pat-down procedures for individuals who chose to opt out of the AIT technology or who set off the traditional metal detector too many times.  I believe that all of these are legitimate concerns, however they are far beyond the scope of my expertise.</p>

<p>While there are many questions surrounding AIT, including which airports will be getting them next and what will happen in congress, one thing that I haven&#8217;t seen is a robust analysis of the costs and risks involved in deploying the scanners across the country.  In this post, I&#8217;m going to put the <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">non-computer science part of my Ph.D.</a> to work and walk through a pretty simple model that allows us to get a first order estimate of the number of lives saved or lost as a result of the AIT body scanners.  In a future post I&#8217;ll go through some of the math on the dollar costs of the body scanners.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is a ton of uncertainty in the science of these scanners and the knowledge of how the public will react.  The fact is that the backscatter x-ray machines do emit radiation, although at very low levels.  The other type of machine, millimeter wave, does not emit radiation. Also, we&#8217;re uncertain about how effective these machines are. They&#8217;re only deployed at a fraction of airports and not all passengers need to go through them.  Even those that go through the scanners cannot be considered 100% effective at stopping a terrorist attack.  Mainly because of well known deficiencies in the scanners, such as their inability to scan body cavities and the fact that <a href="http://www.consumertraveler.com/columns/tsa-myths-and-facts">PETN sewn into the waistband of underwear will not show up on a scanner</a>. Furthermore, the public&#8217;s reaction to these devices is unknown &#8211; will people actually fly less because of the risk of going through a scanner or enhanced pat-down? What all this means is that we can&#8217;t just create a simple set of equations for the model and get a single answer. Instead we need to think in terms of uncertainty and distributions.</p>

<p>There are a variety of great tools that can help us creates models with uncertainty.  Notable is <a href="http://www.lumina.com/ana/whatisanalytica.htm">Analytica</a> from <a href="http://www.lumina.com/">Lumina Decision Systems</a>. Other systems exist, such as Crystal Ball, and a component developed by my team at work, Financier.  As a <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">CMU</a> student I had access to <a href="http://www.lumina.com/ana/whatisanalytica.htm">Analytica</a>, which would have been perfect for this, but my license expired after I received my doctorate. Financier might have worked, but I wanted to make sure that I&#8217;m 100% clear this analysis was done on my personal time and the opinions of this document do not reflect those of my employer.  No company software or hardware was used.</p>

<p>Instead, I took the basic premises that I needed to know and wrote a very simple simulation engine that handles uncertainty in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.  You can <a href="https://github.com/pridkett/TSASimulation">check all of the code from GitHub</a>.  The code documents all of the input variables along with their sources and shows the complete set of equations for the output.  If you&#8217;ve got Python and the <a href="http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/">pyparsing library</a> installed on your system, you should be good to download and run the simulation.  Stats and graphs were created in <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>; the script for their generation is included in the archive.</p>

<h1>Model Inputs</h1>

<p>For each of the model inputs, the best information possible was collected.  I should note, that I&#8217;m not an expert on radiation exposure or terrorism, but I do have quite a bit of psychology background and know how to dig at and critically evaluate numbers.</p>

I added uncertainty to this model.  Frischling&#8217;s estimate of 17% is based on uniform passenger distribution across checkpoints.  I assume that passengers are larger airports are more likely to experience them. Therefore, it may be up to 40% of all passengers who have AIT screening as an option.</p></li>

</ul>


<h1>Model</h1>

<p>In brief, the model estimates the number of additional lives saved or lost because of AIT screening technology.  Lives can be saved by a reduction in the number of fatalities from violent passenger incidents. Lives can be lost by an increase in the number of people driving and an increase in fatal cancers because of backscatter radiation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Number of Passengers Driving:</strong> Passenger Enplanements * Percentage of Passengers Driving
This is how man additional people will be on the road because of opting out of flying altogether.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Number New Driving Fatalities:</strong> Number of Passengers Driving * Flight Distance * 2 * Fatalities per Mile
The distance is multiplied by two here because passengers will need to drive both directions to their destination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected VPI Fatalities:</strong> Risk of Dying from a Violent Passenger Incident * Passenger Enplanements
This is the current baseline number of fatalities expected in a given year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected AIT VPI Fatalities:</strong> Risk of Dying from a Violent Passenger Incident * (1 - AIT Success Rate) * Passenger Enplanements * Percentage of Passengers with AIT Screening + Risk of Dying from a Violent Passenger Incident * Passenger Enplanements * (1 - Percentage of Passengers with AIT Screening)
AIT scanners are only effective where they are used.  This model assumes that the risk of a passenger initiating a VPI has not changed for those passengers not going through AIT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expected Cancer Fatalities:</strong> Passenger Enplanements * Percentage of Passengers with AIT Screening * Percentage of AIT Devices that are Backscatter * Passenger Exposure per Backscatter Screening * Risk of Cancer per &amp;microSv of Exposure
As there is no safe level of radiation exposure, even a small amount can cause cancer.  Here we assume that only those passengers who are exposed to AIT backscatter screening are subject to an increase in their cancer risk.  We do not take into account the inherent increase in radiation from flying as that doesn&#8217;t change. For purposes of simplicity, we also ignore the number of individuals who choose to drive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Fatalities due to AIT:</strong> Number New Driving Fatalities + Expected Cancer Fatalities - (Expected VPI Fatalities - Expected AIT VPI Fatalities)
The total number of new deaths represented in the model minus the expected benefit from AIT.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Model Outcomes</h1>

<p>The model was run through 10000 iterations to produce a range of outcomes.  First, we&#8217;ll start with the expected current number of fatalities from violent passenger incidents.  The skies over the United States have been safe from these incidents since 9/11, so this may be overstating the effect. According to my model the median number of passenger fatalities from VPIs on domestic flights is about 13.7 a year, with a 10/90 confidence window of 11.3-16.1 fatalities a year.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737">A Boeing 737 seats around 162 passengers</a>, so this means one VPI resulting in total loss of all passengers on a Boeing 737 sized plane ever 12-13 years.</p>

        <figcaption>Expected Fatalities from Violent Passenger Incidents (VPIs) </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>With the introduction of the AIT devices at their current deployment levels, the median expected number of fatalities from VPIs is down to 11.1 a year, with a 10/90 confidence window of 9.0-13.3 fatalities a year.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2010/11/expected_ait_vpi_fatalities.png">
        <figcaption>Expected Fatalities from VPI with AIT in Place </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>It&#8217;s quickly apparent there there is little difference between these values.  With AIT there is a median improvement of 2.44 fatalities a year, and even in the best case out of the 10,000 simulations only 6.2 additional lives were saved per year.  From a purely monetary perspective, using the EPA&#8217;s value of $6.9M/life, the AIT project saves $16.84M a year.  I&#8217;m almost certain that the program will cost more than from a strict dollar perspective.</p>

<p>Next, lets examine the increased risk of cancer from these devices.  It&#8217;s believed that any exposure to radiation, no matter how small the dose, increases the chance of cancer.  The TSA has pointed out that under their specifications, backscatter x-ray machines emit about the same amount of radiation as two minutes of flying time (about 0.2µSv).  However, as stated, physics professor Peter Rez has calculated that the likely exposure from a functioning machine is much greater. Using the data from Professor Rez along with known exposure guidelines and the uncertainty in the model, we see there is a median of 3.4 additional cancer fatalities per year, and a 10/90 confidence window of 1.5 to 6.3. The maximum number of new cancer fatalities 11.6/yr. This increase in cancer alone outweighs the median number of lives saved from AIT scanning.</p>

  <figure class='center'>

        <figcaption>Expected Fatalities from Cancer as a Result of Radiation From Backscatter X-Rays </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>However, there is a slightly more insidious and much more dangerous factor in play.  The mere presence of AIT technology in airports and the possible consequences of an enhanced pat-down will lead some to choose to drive rather than fly.  While there have been some reports that show that as many as 20% [citation needed] of people will reconsider flying because of the enhanced pat-down, I considered the estimates to be far lower.  In my model, the median number of people driving was about 17,000,000 with a 10/90 confidence window of 5,800,000 to 28,500,000.  These numbers may seem a little high, but that&#8217;s only about 2% of flights being exchanged for a drive of around 500 miles.  Roughly equivalent to a family deciding to drive from Chicago to Minneapolis for Christmas.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2010/11/expected_passengers_driving.png">
        <figcaption>Expected Number of Passengers Choosing to Drive instead of Fly </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Unfortunately, driving is a much riskier endeavor than flying.  In fact, you&#8217;re more likely to be killed driving to the airport than you are on a plane. Of these people making 1000 mile long round trips, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;ll see about 189 new fatalities with 10/90 confidence window of 65.6 to 321.3 fatalities.  This is a grim picture, indeed.</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2010/11/expected_driving_fatalities.png">
        <figcaption>Expected Fatalities from Passengers Choosing to Drive Instead of Flying </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>Finally, we can take the complete picture; the benefit of the AIT machines versus the increased deaths from driving and cancer and see the total increase in fatalities.  In this case, it&#8217;s not pretty at all.  The use of AIT machines and enhanced pat-downs, when combined with their associated stigma can be expected to cause an additional 190 deaths a year with 10/90 confidence window 67 to 323.  That&#8217;s the equivalent of all the passengers on a 737 and then some EVERY YEAR as a result of the AIT scanning devices.</p>

        <figcaption>Expected Increase in Fatalities as a Result of AIT Scanning </figcaption>
    </figure>


<h1>Shortcomings</h1>

<p>One of the problems with pinpointing deaths is that massive deaths at the same time have a significantly greater impact on public perception than a large amount of distributed deaths that aren&#8217;t always directly attributable.  For example, emissions from coal fired power plants kill significant numbers of people and yet most people are much more scared of nuclear plants because of their potential for an extremely high risk, yet low probability event.  When these events happen react in such a way that the impact is magnified.  More directly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks caused tens of thousands of Americans to cancel their travel plans and businesses to delay investment, which contributed to sending a shaky economy into recession.  This despite the fact that the number of people killed in the attacks was roughly the same number of people killed in a month in traffic accidents across the country or the number of people killed by cancer and heart disease on a DAILY basis. I have no doubt that even the bombing of a cargo flight, with minimal loss to human life, will have a significant and detrimental effect to the American economy, which this simulation cannot model.</p>

<p>This model also does little to address the costs of the screening.  There is not only the cost of the screening devices, but also training of employees, reconfiguration of checkpoints, loss of time for travelers, and treatment for cancer induced by backscatter x-ray.  A robust model would include these, but there is little doubt that the result will remain the same.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The overall risk of deploying AIT scanners is significant given their potential benefit.  An median increase of 190 deaths per year can be expected as the result of increases in cancer from screening and increased road fatalities from people opting out of flying and driving to their destination.  From a pure human life perspective, the AIT proposition is a failure.  Even discounting the fatalities from driving, at current deployment levels AIT devices can be expected to induce 3.3 additional cases of cancer a year while only saving 2.4 additional lives per year. Elimination of the backscatter devices and replacement with millimeter wave detection devices may prove to be a suitable replacement given these substantial health risks.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>

<p>I still consider this analysis in a draft form.  As I can find better information I&#8217;ll update the model.  If you have suggestions on ways to improve the analysis please leave them in the comments.  After I feel that this has been properly vetted, I&#8217;m going to send this to <a href="http://klobuchar.senate.gov/">my</a> <a href="http://franken.senate.gov/">senators</a> and <a href="http://ellison.house.gov/">congressman</a> &#8211; all of which are generally pretty awesome.</p>

    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/03/03/acm-sigs-style-for-zotero</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Academics live and die based on references. A variety of tools exist to manage references, from the sadly ubiquitous <a href="http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>, to manually curated <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> files, to some people who just type their entries by hand with each paper. A variety of web aware citation management tools are also available, for example <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> and <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.</p>

<p>For the past few years I&#8217;ve been using Zotero and have found it to be wonderful (with a few slight exceptions). It lives inside of Firefox and provides one click functionality to add a reference to my database and synchronize the change across computers automagically. It has good plugins for Microsoft Word and OpenOffice to provide citation management on a level that is similar to what one gets on EndNote. It also supports BibTeX export (with some slight key naming issues).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, almost every journal and conference wants slightly different formatting for their references. Zotero can handle this through the use of style files crafted in the <a href="http://xbiblio.sourceforge.net/csl/">Citation Style Language (CSL)</a>. I had noticed that my submission to <a href="http://www.sbs.co.za/ICSE2010/">ICSE 2010</a> was dinged because I had the citations in the wrong format &#8211; apparently I was mistaken and thought they used SIGCHI reference formatting, when in fact they use ACM SIGS reference formatting. Sadly, Zotero doesn&#8217;t have a style for formatting ACM SIGS references, until now. While finishing up <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/wagstrom.net/academic/publications/Williams_2010_SupportingEnterpriseStakeholdersInSoftwareProjects.pdf?attredirects=0&amp;d=1">my paper on supporting stakeholders in enterprise software projects</a> for the <a href="http://www.itu.dk/people/ydi/CHASE2010.html">CHASE 2010</a> workshop I decided it would be easier to bite the bullet and just write my own style that fits the specification.  I don&#8217;t claim that the style is complete, but it seems to work well enough.  You can find the style <a href="http://gist.github.com/320873">hosted as a GitHub gist</a>, an I&#8217;ve also embedded the file below. If you&#8217;re using Zotero you&#8217;ll need to download the raw file then drag it into Zotero where the style will be installed and you&#8217;ll now see ACM SIGS as an option for reference formatting.  Feel free to fork it and improve the formatting. In case the embed does not show up, please visit <a href="http://gist.github.com/320873">http://gist.github.com/320873</a> instead.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/17/dell-inspiron-zino-hd-and-failure/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-17T14:40:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/17/dell-inspiron-zino-hd-and-failure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around work and with friends I&#8217;ve obtained a reputation as the go-to-guy for computer hardware, particular home theater and media center computers. I was really excited about the new Dell Inspiron Zino HD, a tiny little box that can pack a dual core Athlon processor, a couple of gigs of ram, and a decent enough video card to play some games. Starts around $299, and you can get a nicely loaded one for $500. Sounds like a great deal.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I placed an order for an Inspiron Zino HD for my wife and our apartment in Minneapolis. I ordered minor upgrades to make it a bit beefier and faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>AMD Athlon x2 6850</li>
<li>3GB Ram</li>
<li>ATI Radeon HD 4330/512MB RAM video card</li>
<li>320GB hard disk</li>
<li>Dell 1520 802.11 b/g/n wireless card</li>
</ul>


<p>None of these require substantial modifications to the device.  Apparently adding in the video card requires a swap from the standard motherboard to one with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_PCI_Express_Module">MXM</a> video card slot, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

    </figure>


<p>The order was placed on January 31st with an expected delivery date of February 15th thanks to some extra money I paid for expedited shipping.  This was just in time for my monthly visit to Minneapolis where I could set the machine up with Windows 7 Media Center and put it on the wireless network so my wife wouldn&#8217;t need to worry about a thing. To surprise her I also ordered her an HD HomeRun and a nice Windows Media Center remote from Amazon. Instead of using Hulu for everything, she would be able to record everything and not have to wait until the next day to watch shows. This is a godsend to our relationship where otherwise I know that I can&#8217;t call her between 8pm and 10pm EST on Thursdays because of &#8220;30 Rock&#8221; and &#8220;The Office&#8221;.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of last week I started to get concerned.  My order was still listed as &#8220;In Production&#8221;.  On Thursday, the day the machine would have to ship to make it&#8217;s delivery date.  As expected, however, on Friday the website was updated saying that the order was delayed. On Monday afternoon, more than 72 hours after the order was delayed on the website, I finally got an email telling me the order was delayed.  Apparently the tubes are really clogged at Dell.</p>

<p>Yesterday and today I took some time and investigated how many other people had delays and what my other options for.  Some people were advocating the Dell Studio Slim; it looks promising, but it doesn&#8217;t ship until the end of March. Wow. Looking around more I found numerous tales of people who ordered their systems as far back as November and still haven&#8217;t received them:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/p/19310185/19648514.aspx">A retired Librarian&#8217;s tale on dell.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://me-and-dee.web.officelive.com/ZinoHDReview.aspx">Leon Lin, who ordered a Zino in November with Blu-Ray and still hasn&#8217;t received it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/67909965/m/920002762041">RobN from ArsTechnica who ordered one for Christmas and found out it would be substantially delayed</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1202126">Hundreds of posts from AVSForum</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Apparently Dell was insistent on giving 1980&#8217;s order from TV commercials a good name by shipping products not in 6-8 weeks, but in 12+ weeks. In some cases they were actually in violation of FTC standards for how long it was taking to ship products.  Awesome. I knew I had to do something to stop the pain now.</p>

<p>At first I called Dell just to try and get a refund for my expedited shipping. After about ten minutes I finally reached a human in India who asked me what my problem was. I stated very clearly that my order was delayed and therefore I should get a refund for the difference in shipping costs. I was transferred and put on hold for another 10 minutes until I spoke to a nice lady named Priyanka. Unfortunately, she didn&#8217;t understand why this would be a problem and said that they could not change my shipping option now that my system was &#8220;in production&#8221;.  I told it had been &#8220;in production&#8221; for the last two and a half weeks, so I&#8217;m sure she could. No dice.</p>

<p>I attempted to figure out what that issue was. Rumors on the webternets indicate that there is a <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19310185.aspx?PageIndex=2#19620350">lack of black lids for this little guy</a>.  Priyanka didn&#8217;t know about that. I asked if she could change my order to a red lid and if things might ship faster, she said that I&#8217;d have to pay the difference in prices. I explained that if I didn&#8217;t get the red lid that I&#8217;d probably just cancel the order, so either they eat the couple of bucks difference in plastic prices, or lose everything from the order.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, Dell chose the latter. Even though my order was &#8220;in production&#8221; she still allowed me to cancel it. I asked if I would get an email about it, she had no idea what I meant. Finally she said that my order status page would be updated. At the end of the call she asked for my email, I told them that they had it. She said they wanted to update it. I told them my email was firstname at lastname dot net.  She didn&#8217;t get it. So I spelled it out p-a-t-r-i-c-k-@-w-a-g-s-t-r-o-m-.-n-e-t.  She explained that my email address should end in hotmail.com or gmail.com. At this point I wanted to cry. I asked them what they had, she read off patrick@wagstrom.net and insisted that it could not be a valid email address. Just shoot me. I thanked her for her time, informed her that the information was correct and hung up.</p>

<p>Five minutes later I had placed an order for a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883103237">larger, faster, and slightly noisier machine from NewEgg</a>. For $200 in savings and not having to deal with Dell, I can deal with a little bit of noise. Unfortunately, the full review won&#8217;t arrive until the end of March when I&#8217;m back in Minneapolis.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/13/what-qualifies-as-an-open-source-project/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-13T21:26:14-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/13/what-qualifies-as-an-open-source-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spent the last few days at the <a href="http://foss2010.isr.uci.edu/">FOSS2010 Workshop</a> in Irvine, CA.  It&#8217;s an interesting little workshop that brought together some of the best minds in Open Source research from academia, industry, and practice.  The goal was to develop a roadmap for the future of Open Source research.</p>

<p>One issue that constantly comes up is how many Open Source projects exist.  People most often point to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a> as an indicator of success, with it&#8217;s claim on 230,000 projects and more than 2 million users.  However, how many of those are really projects.</p>

<p>First, lets look at activity on SourceForge.  It&#8217;s about halfway through the day on Saturday, and according to the home page here&#8217;s a summary of Today&#8217;s activity:</p>

  <figure class='center'>
        <img src="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/media/2010/02/SourceForgeDailyStats.png">
        <figcaption>Activity as of Noon PST on a Saturday </figcaption>
    </figure>


<p>If there are actually 230,000 active projects this amount is laughable.  I&#8217;ll be generous and say that bug tracking activity is less on a Saturday, so we assume that the 12 hours of data represent 1/1,000 of yearly activity, we&#8217;re getting less than three bugs per project a year.</p>

<p>I polled some of the other folks at the workshop for a definition of a project and I think we&#8217;ve gotten a pretty good idea. First, there is a selection of general project process attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code available under an Open Source license</li>
<li>Publicly accessible web page, bug trackers, mailings lists, and version control</li>
<li>Governance model that allows outside contribution</li>
</ul>


<p>The license is actually the only item that is necessary to call a project Open Source, while publicly accessible collaboration resources and a governance model that allows for participation are conditions that are required for any sort of community to emerge.  However, under these terms it still is possible to have a project that is run by a single person and isn&#8217;t really open.  I can still create a project, release it under an Open Source license, register it on SourceForge, and say I accept contributions, but it won&#8217;t really be Open Source in most people&#8217;s definition of the words.</p>

<p>After talking to various other quite intelligent people within the community I&#8217;d like to propose the following criteria for calling a project truly Open Source:</p>

<ul>
<li>At least three different contributors</li>
<li>Code that can be compiled and run by someone with only moderate skill in the field and without significant external resources</li>
<li>A social process that not only allows contribution, but actively mentors new developers</li>
<li>Active participation by individuals who write no code</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll go over each of these criteria and explain why they&#8217;re necessary for a first cut of determining whether or not a project is truly Open Source.</p>

<p>One of the key elements of Open Source development is that it is a collaborative effort by multiple developers.  Advantages include utilizing the expertise of each of the different developers and having many developers looking over the code to ensure to identify bugs.  If a project is just one or two people then it is unlikely that there is always enough overlap of individuals examining code.  Furthermore, it&#8217;s unlikely that the strategy process for designing and developing new features needs to be collaborative at all.  Fortunately, this is something that can be easily ascertained through automated methods when mining software communities.</p>

<p>The next requirement is that the project actually be able to compile by people of moderate skill in the field.  This is important because not everyone in the field of interest is going to be an expert.  If you require everyone to be an expert then the community will have trouble growing.  Requiring expensive libraries or exotic compilers has a similar effect and dramatically limits the pool of individuals.  It also may signify that the community really isn&#8217;t interested in harness the resources of an open community.  This raises some interesting questions about existing projects, for example, VISTA is a widely used system for managing hospital infrastructure from the Veterans Administration of the United States, but it written in MUMPS, a language that few people know and with even fewer compilers (I&#8217;m aware that in the strictest sense VISTA isn&#8217;t Open Source anyway, as the core is public domain, but we&#8217;ll ignore that for now).  How does this compare to open source code designed to run on Oracle&#8217;s high end databases?  I don&#8217;t have a clear answer, but when weighing projects it&#8217;s something to be aware of.</p>

<p>Next up is a social process that mentors new developers.  Sadly this is one place where many Open Source projects end up falling flat.  For example, GLIBC under the iron hand of Ulrich Drepper fails this category.  When dealing with potential future developers, it&#8217;s necessary to actively ensure they learn the process.  This includes simple things such as helping developers understand the process roadmap, explaining why bugs are rejected or marked as dupes, and responding to users on mailing lists in a gentle manner.  Now clearly, at some point projects need to put some of the impetus for learning on the potential community members or we&#8217;ll end up with hundreds of Bowie J. Poags, but I&#8217;d imagine for every Bowie you&#8217;ll get a couple of genuinely helpful developers.</p>

<p>The final issue is obtaining contributions from individuals who don&#8217;t write code.  For a long time there has been a perception that the code is all that really matters.  This was reinforced through some early writing such as the Cathedral and the Bazaar and misinterpretations of Lessig&#8217;s Code.  The most successful projects all have numerous individuals who write no code, instead they write documentation, create art, support users on the mailing lists and chat channels, and act as general promoters of the software across all media. The fact of the matter is that although I know many skilled coders who may excel in some of these additional areas, they can&#8217;t do it all alone.  Without these other individuals, you don&#8217;t really have an Open Source project.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t claim that these criteria are perfect for identifying &#8220;true&#8221; Open Source projects, but they do help to ensure that projects at least have some of the key elements of what is generally considered to be Open Source and have a chance of being successful. I also don&#8217;t see this as competing with something like Tony Wasserman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.openbrr.org/">Open BRR</a>, rather, for individuals researching Open Source they should be a guideline for identifying projects that will be interesting and exhibit the behaviors that make Open Source interesting to study in the first place.</p>

    <link href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/04/command-line-updating-pages-on-google-sites/"/>
    <updated>2010-02-04T21:38:28-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2010/02/04/command-line-updating-pages-on-google-sites</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About eighteen months ago I migrated <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/">my academic web pages</a> away from a self hosted solution on a Linux box in my living room to <a href="http://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a>.  Mainly this was done because I was applying for jobs and wanted to make sure that the site would be reliable.  But although I came for the reliability, I stayed for the features.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s true that Google Sites is somewhat limiting in what you can do.  You can&#8217;t do fun stuff with <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and highly customized CSS is verboten.  It&#8217;s not going to work for someone who needs to share a design portfolio.  However, for an academic it works really well.  Basically, I need a set of pages about <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/">my research</a>, <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/publications">copies of my papers</a> and <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/presentations">presentations</a>, and various forms of <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/resume">my résumé</a> and <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/cv">cv</a>.  These are all typically boring pages that can be created with some simple HTML.  Google Sites manages that and even helps them look good too.</p>

<p>At that time I also realized that I needed to be a bit more flexible in how I handled my resume and CV.  Up until this point I had a highly customized LaTeX file that generated a very pretty PDF.  The beauty was only skin deep, underneath the PDF it was ugly, difficult to maintain, and if I wanted to paste portions of the document in to an email or someone requested a word document version, I was out of luck.</p>

<p>At the time I still hadn&#8217;t gotten <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/2009/11/25/shutting-down-pennave/">my head on straight regarding how XML should never be used by humans</a>, so I chose the <a href="http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/">XML Résumé Library</a>, an Open Source package that hasn&#8217;t been updated in a couple of years.  The library consists of an XML DTD that defines elements of a resume and a set of XSLT files that translate your resume into various formats, including text, html, and FO.  I can then use the FO files to generate PDF, DOCX, and ODT files.  Simple enough. Now I have a single source document with a Makefile that compiles the file into both my résumé and cv.</p>

<p>The problem is that I provide each document in five different formats, which means that I needed to upload 10 documents every time that I changed something.  This was not ideal at all.</p>

<p>Luckily, Google is in the process of making open APIs for all of their tools and last September they finally released the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/sites/">Google Sites API</a>.  It still isn&#8217;t 100% complete, but with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/">2.0.7 release of the python libraries</a> it is finally to the point where the python library is suitable for updating documents.</p>

<p>I whipped up a simple little python script that uploads files from the command line to Google Sites.  It only works with documents that have previously been uploaded by hand, so in that sense, it only updates documents.  You can find <a href="http://gist.github.com/295408">site_uploader.py as a github gist</a> or it should be embedded below.</p>

<p>The script itself has only been tested on apps for domains and has a couple of mandatory options:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>-s/&#8211;site</strong>: The name of the site to update.  This isn&#8217;t the URL, but the name in your admin panel for the site.</li>
<li><strong>-d/&#8211;domain</strong>: The domain name of your apps for domain setup.  I&#8217;m not certain what happens if you don&#8217;t include this because all of my sites are hosted through Apps for Domains.</li>
<li><strong>-u/&#8211;user</strong>: The username to use for accessing the Google Sites API.</li>
<li><strong>-p/&#8211;pass</strong>: The password for the user account. The sites API provides multiple different authentication methods.  For my own convenience I have my Makefile prompt me for a password with Zenity then invoke the script.  I&#8217;m on a laptop which means the chance of someone else seeing my password in the process list is pretty slim.</li>
<li><strong>ENTRY_ID</strong>: each document on your site has an entry_id that doesn&#8217;t change with updates.  Think of it like a UUID.</li>
<li><strong>NEW_DOCUMENT</strong>: the filename of the new document to store on Google sites.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you&#8217;re first getting started with sites_uploader you can also use the <strong>&#8211;list</strong> option to get a list of all the documents on the site and their entry_id values.  Here&#8217;s what a simple session might look like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>patrick@wallaby$ python sites_uploader.py -s "dummy" -d "wagstrom.net" -u "patrick@wagstrom.net" -p "PASSWORD" --ssl --list
</span><span class='line'>    ["attachment.png", "attachment", "https://sites.google.com/feeds/content/wagstrom.net/dummy/9999384153430219999"]
</span><span class='line'>    ["Home", "webpage", "https://sites.google.com/feeds/content/wagstrom.net/dummy/9999953700077559999"]
</span><span class='line'>    ["files", "filecabinet", "https://sites.google.com/feeds/content/wagstrom.net/test/9999182398032899999"]
</span><span class='line'>    patrick@wallaby$ python sites_uploader.py -s "dummy" -d "wagstrom.net" -u "patrick@wagstrom.net" -p "PASSWORD" --ssl https://sites.google.com/feeds/content/wagstrom.net/dummy/9999953700077559999 home.html</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This examines the site &#8220;dummy&#8221; under &#8220;wagstrom.net&#8221; by first listing all the documents, of which there are three: a png file called &#8220;attachment.png&#8221;, a webpage called &#8220;home&#8221;, and a filecabinet called &#8220;files&#8221;.  We note the id of the webpage called &#8220;home&#8221; and wish to replace its content with that of home.html.  When an operation is successful it prints out nothing.</p>

<p>The beauty of using id&#8217;s is that they don&#8217;t change, so once you look them up and put them into your Makefile, you&#8217;ll never need to change them again.  The other nice thing about Google Sites is that it sanitizes your HTML, so you can feed it a complete HTML file and it is smart enough to just take the part that belongs in the body of the document.  Pretty neat stuff indeed.</p>

<p>The code for the tool should be pretty straight forward, but folks have questions feel free to email me and I&#8217;ll attempt to answer.</p>
