  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apparently my <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/index.rss">RSS feed</a> is sick.  I&#8217;m
not quite sure why.  There are two major ways that this sickness is showing itself.  Firstly,
it&#8217;s not putting spaces around links on <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">BlogLines</a>.  This
was pointed out by a helpful reader and it appears to be doing it on all my entries.  Secondly,
when I read the entries on <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/blam/">Blam!</a> it really does
a good job of mangling them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tracked this down to a few different problems in my setup.  First
off, I need to point out that I&#8217;m using
<a href="http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/">PyBlosxom 0.82</a> and
have no intention of upgrading.  I&#8217;ve got too many custom modules to
deal with.  Anyway, basically PyBlosxom just takes an entry and pastes
the entire contents into the page returned.  While this works well for
HTML pages, in an RSS feed I need to escape all the &lt; and > symbols.
Or at least I think I do.  In any case, I&#8217;m pretty sure the unescaped
HTML in the body is confusing Blam!  The unescaped HTML also makes my
feed fail to validate as most of the HTML tags are not defined for
RSS.</p>

<p>The other problem is that I use some custom XML in these pages.  When
you view the pages on the web at
<a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/">http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/</a>,
you&#8217;re really downloading a plain old XML file.  This XML file has a
preprocessor directive that tells your browser to go grab an XSLT
stylesheet to render the page.  If you&#8217;re using
<a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=38177&amp;t=82">FireFox</a> to
read this, do a view source command to see what I mean.  Your browser
then takes care of transforming the XML into HTML on the client side.
It&#8217;s all rather neato.  If you have a browser that can&#8217;t do this
properly, like Internet Explorer, then the server does it for you, but
only for the HTML pages.  This means that when you download the RSS
feed, you still see these weird XML tags because the feed has not been
run against my stylesheet.  For example in the RSS feed, you may see
something like &lt;my:imagestrip>&#8230;&lt;/my:imagestrip> instead of a nice
row of pictures.  This is my special markup for a strip of images in
the web page.  Well, that won&#8217;t get rendered in your feed reader.
Suckage.</p>

<p>Fortunately, if we remember that the actual page is XML, we might be
able to cook up a solution.  It&#8217;s not a secret that I&#8217;m not a big fan
of the way that PyBlosxom does some stuff, especially how much of the
stuff like RSS is hard coded.  What I can do is cook up an XSLT
stylesheet that will take the same XML that your browser downloads and
use that to create an RSS feed.  Which is probably what I&#8217;m going to
do.  However, I&#8217;ve got a
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~guestrin/Class/10701/">machine learning</a>
test on Monday and a house to buy a week after that, so don&#8217;t expect
it real soon, but you never know.  When that happens, I&#8217;ll also try to
make a nice ATOM feed so I can hang out with the cool kids.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had my MGA G400-MAX dual head video card since I built my current desktop
computer back in April of 2000.  I&#8217;ve used the second head for xinerama and dual
monitor work in the past, it always worked pretty nicely.  I sold the second
monitor last year after I got my laptop.  I figured I might as well get the
second head to output on the TV.</p>

<p>Using the drivers provided by Matrox I was able to get the second head to
output to the TV, but I couldn&#8217;t get XV accelerated video.  This left me
very sad as it meant that I there wasn&#8217;t any chance of me getting
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> running on the TV.  Well, today
I finally fixed that problem.  Yay!</p>

<p>I utilized the nice
<a href="http://davedina.apestaart.org/download/doc/Matrox-TVOUT-HOWTO-0.1.txt">G400 TVOut HowTo</a>
from <a href="http://thomas.apestaart.org/">Thomasvs</a> to get going.
Amazingly, almost everything was easily installed from apt.  The
kernel already had all of the modules compiled, so that was no
problem.  fbset was installed via apt.  I needed to go visit the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/matroxset">debian matroxset packages</a>.
On <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> these installed without any
problem.</p>

<p>The next thing I did was to make the system load the appropriate modules
at run time.  So I added the following lines to my
<code>/etc/modules</code> file, which autoloads modules at
system boot time.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    matroxfb_crtc2
</span><span class='line'>    matroxfb_maven</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next step was to create a startup script.  I&#8217;ve pasted that below.  Save
this as <code>/etc/init.d/matroxTVOut</code>.</p>

<p>And you&#8217;ll need to add this your default startup scripts using
<code>update-rc.d</code>.  We&#8217;re almost there, the final step is to setup X11 so we
can run it on the framebuffer device.  The default Ubuntu setup is
basically right, but we need to make some changes.  We need to change
the device setting.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Section "Device"
</span><span class='line'>        Identifier      "Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP"
</span><span class='line'>        Driver          "mga"
</span><span class='line'>        BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
</span><span class='line'>        Option          "hw cursor" "off"
</span><span class='line'>        Option          "UseFBDev" "on"
</span><span class='line'>EndSection</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And the last little touch is to setup the output resolution in X11.
This little snippet should take care of it for you.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Section "Screen"
</span><span class='line'>        Identifier      "Default Screen"
</span><span class='line'>        Device          "Matrox Graphics, Inc. MGA G400 AGP"
</span><span class='line'>        Monitor         "AccuSync 95F"
</span><span class='line'>        DefaultDepth    16
</span><span class='line'>        DefaultFbBPP    16
</span><span class='line'>        SubSection "Display"
</span><span class='line'>                Depth 16
</span><span class='line'>                Modes "800x600"
</span><span class='line'>        EndSubSection
</span><span class='line'>EndSection</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And voila.  We should have everything setup to make X11 run at 800x600
mode with output on both the monitor and the TV.  You&#8217;ll want to look
at Thomasvs&#8217;

<time datetime="2005-03-07T17:25:00-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 7<span>th</span>, 2005</time>
        
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s spring break so I decided I would play a few video games.  I&#8217;ve got
a bunch of the old Linux ports of games from
<a href="http://www.lokigames.com/">LokiGames</a> (which went bankrupt in
a mess of supposed lies and missed payments in January, 2002).  Unfortunately,
these games need some work to function in Linux.  Well, at least the ones that
I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>For Alpha Centauri, you should first go and fetch the patch for SMAC.  The
updates can be found at
<a href="ftp://sunsite.dk/mirrors/lokigames/updates/">sunsite.dk</a>.  Go
and download that.  Also, go and download the updated version of loki_patch
from <a href="http://icculus.org/~msphil/loki/x86/">icculus</a>.  Now, install
the game as you would normally.  The install worked just fine under my
version of Ubuntu (Warty, aka 4.10).</p>

<p>The tricky part comes with patching Alpha Centauri.  Running the patch generates
the following output:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Verifying archive integrity...OK
</span><span class='line'>Uncompressing Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri 6.0a Update...................
</span><span class='line'>./update.sh: line 60: 11336 Segmentation fault      loki_patch --verify patch.dat
</span><span class='line'>The program returned an error code (1)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This clearly isn&#8217;t right.  So instead of running the patch normally, we&#8217;ve got
to do a bit of work.  Instead, run the patch with
<code>sh ./smac-6.0a-x86.run --keep</code>, this will preserve
the unarchived files in a directory called
<code>smac-6.0a-x86</code>.  Copy the new version of <code>loki_patch</code>
to <code>smac-6.0a-x86/bin/Linux/x86/loki_patch</code>.  Then go into the directory and
run <code>update.sh</code>.</p>

<p>So now we&#8217;ve got a nice updated version of Alpha Centauri, but it still wasn&#8217;t
spitting out sound on my version of Ubuntu (I&#8217;ve mangled some stuff with
regards to <a href="http://http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> and ESD.
Also, I&#8217;ve read that there are some other issues with kernel versions.  To fix
this I created a little script and use this to run SMAC.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</span><span class="o">=</span>2.4.6 <span class="nv">SDL_AUDIODRIVER</span><span class="o">=</span>esd /usr/local/games/smac/smacpack <span class="nv">$*</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It may be possible to do other fun stuff using the
<a href="ftp://ptah.lnf.kth.se/pub/misc/sdl-env-vars">other SDL environment variables</a>.
As a side note, I could not get the dynamic version to function
properly, which is bummer because it means that I can&#8217;t really update
the libraries and try other fun stuff with them.</p>

<p>As I play with other old games I&#8217;ll post updates on how to get them going
in the weblog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night Kristina and I went out with a group of folks from school
to the
<a href="http://www.rmuislandsports.org/">Robert Morris University Island Sports Center</a>
and hung out with the
<a href="http://www.pittsburghcurlingclub.com/">Pittburgh Curling Club</a>.  It
was different to say the least.  I think every one of us fell down at
least a few times.  But it was definately fun and I think we may
consider doing it again.  At the very least, at $10 a person, it was a
very cheap way to spend a Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s two of the shots I took.  Unfortunately, I realized after I left that
the light balance was off.  Also, the PowerShot A75 is not the best for getting
active shots.  Oh yeah, and my batteries died during the evening.  Hopefully
<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~phines/">Paul</a> got some better shots.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title about sums it up.  Apparently <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> is being bit in the ass by a rather nasty <a href="https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=6749">NFS server bug</a> that prevents writing to the NFS drives.  It just creates 0 byte files.  Well, not exactly.</p>

<p>I realized that when my laptop (2GHz) is on the wired connnection it can transcode recorded programs much faster than my master backend (700MHz).  So I figured I&#8217;d have the laptop transcode <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/">Forrest Gump</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085995/">Vacation</a> for me.  I went through and cut out all of the commercials and set the laptop to trim the files for me.  It seemed like everything was going well enough.  A check on the NFS directory showed the .nuv.tmp files were be created by mythtranscode.  There were a few errors being spit out by the laptops instance of mythbackend, but usually I can ignore those.  Then disaster.  When done transcoding the original .nuv file is removed and replaced by the .nuv.tmp file.  This failed. Bye bye Forrest.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m back to transcoding on the Athlon backend, no biggie, just takes longer. But I have to wonder, when will I be able to replace Forrest?  Sigh.  Let&#8217;s hope the good guys at Ubuntu get this fixed soon.  Until then, DO NOT USE KERNEL 2.6.8.1-5 ON UBUNTU.  At least not if you&#8217;re running an NFS server, it&#8217;ll hork your files and eat your children.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now that my system has some reasonable hard drive, I&#8217;ve been working
on other bells and whistles with <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>.
After the 0.17 upgrade I found that my remote no longer worked, mainly
because I forgot to tell Myth to compile with
<a href="http://www.lirc.org/">LIRC</a> support.  I decided since I was flubbing
around, I might as well upgrade my system kernel to the K7 kernel (my
mythbox is an Athlon 700).  This went well, but somewhere along the
line (I think before the upgrade) the alsa drivers for my SB!Live card
got toasted.  Oddly enough, I can load the driver, but I don&#8217;t get any
sound out of the system.  If I unload the snd_emu10k1 driver and stop
alsa and load the OSS emu10k1 then stuff seems to work okay in OSS
mode.  Still a pain.  Because the system is basically only a Myth Box
this should work okay.</p>

<p>Long story short on all these problems is that I need to document what I&#8217;ve
been doing better.  Specifically the fact that I&#8217;m not using the LIRC kernel
driver for my remote, I&#8217;m using the Linux input layer.  This caused me endless
frustration especially when I saw that LIRC refused to create valid kernel
modules for the system.</p>

<p>I also hacked around some of my startup scripts so the system is dead simple
to use now.  Basically when the computer starts up it starts a GDM session
first, and another XSession just for Myth afterwards.  I&#8217;ll post some of that
on how I did it in my <a href="/weblog/tutorials/">tutorials</a> section sometime
next week.</p>

<p>With regards to 0.17, it&#8217;s quite nice.  I especially like the time speedup
option for viewing programs.  While 1.5x starts to be a little annoying,
watching Conan at 1.2x normal speed is really nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Mark Cuban</a> takes a lot of
crap from people for being a little out there.  He reminds me a bit of
Howard Dean, he&#8217;s doing things to shake people up and get them off their
comfortable asses.  He&#8217;s not only the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, but
also is a major player in the migration to HDTV.  Last week he wrote
a great article about why FCC should <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000893032857">call the broadcater&#8217;s bluff</a>.</p>

<p>To sum it up, HDTV is out of the bag.  It&#8217;s big business.  The content
producers will not stop broadcasting in HDTV if they don&#8217;t get their crappy
little flag.  The flag is anti-consumer, and Mark is proud to say that his
production companies aren&#8217;t going to use it.  So the flag is of great
value for him, not because it will protect his content, he&#8217;s smart enough to
realize that you can&#8217;t, but because his stuff won&#8217;t use it and it will make
the consumers happy.  Cheers for him.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure if Dave is going to post my response to interesting people, but
I figured that I&#8217;d post it here.  I don&#8217;t like how Googlebashing seems to be
the in thing.  I happen to like Google.  Their autolink feature of their
toolbar is an option that is not on by default, and yet people complain about
it.  The most recent one was some complaining that you could do reverse
phone numbers in Google.  The horror!  Here is my response as I sent it to
Dave.</p>

For IP if you'd like.

Dave,

While it might be the hip thing to bash Google for this, they are not
the only web site that has this feature.  For example, a quick look
reveals that Verizon has this ability [1] as does
ReversePhoneDirectory.com [2].  A simple search on Google will reveal
many more.  So it's not just Google that "helps burglers [sic]".

What many folks should be more worried about is the growing amount of
other records online.  For example, in my house hunt in Pittsburgh, I
was able to look up large amounts of information on the various
properties through Allegheny county's property website [3].  This allows
a search not only by address, but also by name.  On each property I was
able to get information about the owners real address, the mortgage
holder, tax status, sale price, building condition, a map, and a whole
lot more.  Thus, knowing only her last name, I was able to find the
address, photos, and a floorplan of Teresa Heinz Kerry's house out in
Fox Chapel[4].

My assumption (for what it's worth) is that Google has some people
working there who are aware of the privacy implications of such a
system; they do have a way to opt out.  When small municipalities
without knowledgable privacy folks start putting this information online
we have a much greater issue.

&gt; Google has implemented a new feature where you can type someone's
&gt; telephone number into the search bar and hit enter and then you will be
&gt; given a map to their house.  Everyone should be aware of this.  Note
&gt; that you can have your phone number removed or blocked.
&gt;
&gt; What a great tool for burglars!!
&gt;
&gt; Look up your own number:
&gt;
&gt; 1)  Go to: http://www.google.com/
&gt;
&gt; 2)  Type your phone number in the search bar (i.e. 555-555-1212) and hit
&gt; enter.
&gt;
&gt; 3)  If you want to BLOCK Google from divulging your private information,
&gt; go to the "results" and choose the "phone book removal form."
&gt;
&gt; Google lists several other search engines that provide reverse phone
&gt; number searches. You have to block each one separately.
&gt;
&gt; Removal takes 48-hours.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Sunday morning I ordered myself a nice little pre-passing-qualifiers present: a shiny new 200 GB hard drive from Staples.  After rebate I got it for about $40 or so.  Not a bad deal.  However, installing it was a royal pain.  I&#8217;m convinced that if I buy more I&#8217;m just going to get a firewire card and make them external.</p>

<p>The problem resulted from the wiring in my case, which still uses ribbon ATA cables and how I needed to move some drives around and disable my plain 56x CD rom drive.   Then I made the mistake of using the MaxBlast setup software, which ended up blowing away my installation of GRUB.  Unfortunately, the Ubuntu Live-CD was providing no love when it came to reinstalling grub.  So I went and made a fresh Ubuntu install on the new drive, then used that to fix my grub for my old drive.  Much more hassle than it should be.  Fortunately, my system recognizes that 200GB drive in linux, even though the bios says it&#8217;s only 137GB.  Yay.  This means 200 hours of TV.</p>
