title: PennAve 0.4 Released Today

[PennAve](http://pennave.sf.net/), the web gallery application that works in conjunction with [F-Spot](http://www.f-spot.org/) released version 0.4 today.  This newest release brings a slew of new   features including:

  * New user interface
  * Better support for internationalization
  * Improvements to splash intro page
  * Use of the much improved [CherryPy 3.0](http://www.cherrypy.org/)
  * Option for server side rendering of HTML
  * Canvas tag support for intro pages
  * A slew of little bug fixes

I haven't gotten my [personal gallery](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/) running this newest version yet, but I hope to do so in the next few days.  In the mean time, if you use PennAve, I highly recommend checking out this package for sharing your photos online.  With it, publishing a nice web gallery is as simple as running rsync.  PennAve natively utilizes copies of your F-Spot data files, leaving very little additional work or tools for you. Just create a tag called "Public" and start tagging photos that you want share. All while retaining complete control over the presentation of your photos.
