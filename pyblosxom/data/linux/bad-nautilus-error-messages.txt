Useless Error Messages in Nautilus

Here's a prime example of what happens when programmers write error messages:

This is an error that was repeated several times for different files when I
was copying over some newly ripped CDs from my laptop to my MythTV box.
Unfortunately, there are several things wrong with this error dialog that
make it useless:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I can't see the complete filename, nor can I expand the box to make the
complete filename visible.  In this case I could make out where it was having
problems, but if I had a common naming structure for files across many
directories, I would not be able to tell where it was having problems.</li>
<li>"Access Denied" is a very vague term.  Is it access denied on the source
or the destination?  Other one of which can cause such a problem.  In this
case the problem was a lack of write permissions for the destination directory
on the server, but it does not make it clear that if its a problem with reading
the file or writing the file.</li>
<li>Lastly, it does not make a distinction if this is a file or a directory
that it's having problems with.  In this case it was a directory, but given how
Windows and Mac folks are lazy about file extensions, that may not always be
so obvious.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's funny, it seems like an error dialog is such a simple little thing, but
making one not work correctly can be big problems.  Chalk this up to another
"it's shouldn't be so difficult".
