I got another hedgehog today, his name is Simba and he is an absolutely
enomrous albino.  He really needs to loose some weight.  Introduction to Brutus
went about as well as could be expected.  Brutus really seems indifferent to
Simba's existence.  I'm not sure if it's because he's used to being handled so
much, or because of his vision and not being able to see Simba.

Simba, on the other hand, is a different story.  It's gonna take him some time
to adjust to being around new people and another hedgehog.  He bites both me
and Brutus.  Tommorow I'll get a cage expansion for him for the time being.
Right now I just have a jar of jelly blocking their path through the tunnel to
the other side.

I'm going to be taking them out periodically to meet each other and get
acquainted.  When they get angry and attack each other, they get zapped with
water from a squirt gun.  It seems like that's a pretty common way to
discipline rowdy pogs.  Not a lot of water, but enough to annoy them.
Hopefully this will let the two get better acclimated and eventually allow me
to remove the roadblock between the sides of the cage.
