Dual Monitor Happiness in GNOME
<!-- Date: 2008-07-14 10:50 -->

<p> As far back as the middle of 2000 I've been using multiple
monitors for my daily work routine (see <a
href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/screenshots/shots/20000830.jpg">this
screenshot for some proof</a>.  That's done with a couple of PCI
voodoo cards and a built in RAGE AGP card).  It's probably one of the
best decisions you can make regarding your work productivity,
especially if you work on a laptop.  I'm not the only one who thinks
this either, Jeff Atwood of CodingHorror.com frequently extols the <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001076.html">virtues
of multiple of monitors</a> and points to a study that found that
individuals using 2 20 inch monitors were 44% more productive than
those using a single 18 inch monitor.  Of course, people using a 24
inch monitor were 54% more productive than the 18 inch monitor, and by
transitive property, the most productive.
</p>
<p>
However, with laptops, it isn't the case that you can just buy a
bigger monitor.  In fact, I'm probably not the only person who wishes
that their laptop was actually smaller -- and I've got a fairly small
laptop right now, a 14.1 inch IBM T43p, but it's absolutely huge
compared to my wife's X series.  To solve some of these issues, I have
external monitors both at home and in the office that help out
considerably.  However, like most things in Linux, multi-monitor
support is painful.

<p>
Or, rather it was, until <a href="http://www.keithp.com/">Keith
Packard</a> gave the X subsystem a good swift boot to the head with
XRandR 1.2, which now allows hotplugging of monitors.  Gone are the
days of having to kill my X session to do a presentation.  It's bliss
baby.  However, Keith is not a GUI genius, at Boston GNOME Summit 2006 he
threatened the community with designing his own GUI.  Immediately
everyone was revolted as Keith showed the most popular GUI he
designed: xmille.

<p>
Well, for the most part, the community didn't respond.  In late 2007
when I started running the betas of Ubuntu Gutsy, I needed to features
of XRandR 1.2 for presentations.  Well, the only GUI at the time,
GRandR, was done by a someone working with Keith at Intel, it crashed
fairly often.  I fixed some bugs, and posted my
own <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/code/grandr-public-git-repo.xml">git
public repository</a> last year.  The problem is that I didn't have
time to really maintain the project.
</p>
<p>
I was pleasantly surprised to see that Ubunty Hardy (2008.04) included
a wonderful little applet as part of the GNOME control center, the
Monitor Resolution Settings applet.  Using this little applet, XRandR
1.2 compliant drivers (basically any open source driver) get a great
little GUI to easily set and configure monitors.  It even allows the
arbitrary location of monitors relative to one another.  It's a great
little tool.  Now, if only the open source ATI drivers supported
accelerated monitor rotation on a second head, then I could actually
rotate my 20 inch monitor at home for working on long documents.  For
the time being, this works well enough.  In fact, it's a lifesaver
when giving presentations.  Nothing spells tacky like having everyone
see your login as you kill X to give a presentation.
