Amazingly enough PriDB seems to be working pretty well.  I'm also working on a test project to work in tandem with it called
PriBlog.  Basically, it will use some of the features of PriDB to do interesting things with my blog.  Anyway, I'v managed to
implement the LIMIT keyword.  I also fixed the regex parser that handles the XPathQL on the server
side.






I've also been thinking about moving away from using XMLRPC for the interface method.  The problem is that using XMLRPC is
so easy in Python, however, it doesn't allow stateful connections, so logins have to be done using the same backwards
mechanisms that one would use to allow authentication in HTTP.  Sigh.   Anyway, right now my main goal is to get PriBlog
working with a PriDB backend.  Then I'll extend PriDB to do other cool stuff.
