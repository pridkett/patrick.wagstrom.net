I Help Teams Build Better Software
----------------------------------

It's relatively easy to put together a small piece of software, such
as software to generate and serve a weblog or a tool that uses
publicly available APIs to give you the current value of your stock
portfolio. Unfortunately, most software is far more complex - not only
due to the technical requirements of the software, but also the way
the software needs to interface with existing backend systems and the
various individuals and organizations that will use the software.

In my role as a research staff member in the Software Governance group
at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, I
develop technologies, methods, and processes that enable teams to
build high quality reliable software. One of our primary tools to do
this is better analytics of software development. We're able to
harness data from all aspects of the development process -
requirements generation, planning, development, testing, deployment,
and finally end user actions - they have all have potential areas to
develop systems of insight to shed light on the development
process. This allows teams to use real data to back up decisions made
for their development processes and removes the guess work from
software engineering.

Research Background
--------------------
I have a rather interdisciplinary academic background that has served
my research goals well. In 2009 I obtained a Ph.D. in [Engineering and
Public Policy][epp] and [Computation, Organizations, and Society][cos]
from [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]. Engineering and Public Policy
is an interdisciplinary program in the College of Engineering that focuses on the interconnect
between the world's engineering challenges, such as clean energy,
using IT to support development, data privacy, and improving our
nation's electrical grid and how these challenges affect public
policy decisions. It seeks to create engineers and scientists who can
advise on both the technical and political realities of the
issues. Computation, Organizations, and Society is an
interdisciplinary program in the School of Computer Science at
Carnegie Mellon that takes a broad view of computer science and looks
at how the technologies we create interact with society as a whole,
which can include public policy related issues, but also includes
human-computer interaction, social equity, privacy, and social network
magnification of technology.

This resulted in a thesis that examined the complex ways that Open
Source projects work in the presence of commercial
participation. We've moved far beyond the point where open source
projects are developed by altruistic hackers in their spare time, if
there ever was such a time, and my work examined how individuals,
firms, and non-profit foundations worked together to produce value. It
did this by examining the way that foundations, such as the Eclipse
Foundation, work with member companies. Then delved into a technical
analysis of how firms work with one another and how their presence
affects individual developers. Finally, it looked at how individual
developers work together through the lens of the socio-technical
congruence metric.

This research used a variety of methods, including ethnographic
observations, qualitative interviews, and a lot of data mining of
archival software development resources, which led me to my current
role in the software governance team at IBM Research. Currently I work
on a variety of projects around IBM, the most prominent of which is
[JazzHub][jazzhub] - IBM's cloud based development environment.
