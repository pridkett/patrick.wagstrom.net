I've got a bit of a live demo of the gallery software running at [http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/](http://patrick.wagstrom.net/gallery/).
Right now it mainly goes to show one thing, my web server is VERY VERY slow.
If you hit a page that hasn't been hit before, it will be very slow as there
is the need to have the script resize the image.  Considering this server is
the computer that I had when I first went to college back in 1997, that can
take a while for large photos, like the digital camera shots.  Luckily, it
caches the photos for faster access later.
