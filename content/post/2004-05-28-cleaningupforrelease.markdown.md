I'm in the process of cleaning up my gallery software for an initial release
and posting to [SourceForge](http://www.sf.net/).  Mainly this consists of
moving stuff into different files, and putting credits on the files.  However,
this has introduced the need to watch how I was implementing some things as the
original proof of concept was nothing more than one 500 line python script.
This meant that everything was in the same namespace, which shouldn't be.

In any case, with the holiday weekend, I'll probably have a bit of time to set
up the project over at SourceForge and then I'll post more details
about it over there.
