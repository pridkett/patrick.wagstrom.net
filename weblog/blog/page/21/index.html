  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I talked about how to
<a href="/weblog/weblog/meta/rssCaching.xml">cache RSS feeds in PyBlosxom</a> using only
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>, a
cron job, and a package of
<a href="http://www.twinkies.com/">hostess twinkies</a>.  Today, I&#8217;m going a
little further.  I&#8217;ve been having problems with link spammers hitting
my pages and using up my bandwidth.  I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re all
coming from the same source, but they&#8217;re not the same block of IP
addresses, maybe they&#8217;re zombied.  Anyway, the urls are all terribly
predictable like http://www.car-insurancedeals-4u.info/ or something
like that.  Anyway, they&#8217;re all .info domains with multiple dashes in
the domain name.  Being as there are basically no legitimate .info or
.biz sites, I can guarantee that someone is up to no good.  On the
offhand that you are .info site that would like to link to me, I can
allow the link by changing my config.  Just email me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I whipped up a bit more mod_rewrite fun to look at the referer
and if they&#8217;re from one of these &#8220;sites&#8221;, then it sends them a
forbidden error.  Should help save some bandwidth and also stop these
idiots from appearing all the time in my logs.</p>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nb">RewriteRule</span> ^.*$ - [F]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I realize that this has the potential to turn into an arms race.  Oh
well.  Maybe some day I&#8217;ll get around to building a better firewall
for my network and have this all done through
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/">pf</a> or
<a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/">layer 7 filtering</a> or something
like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s getting to the point where I need to stop doing server generation
for my RSS feed whenever it is requested.  Mainly because RSS seems to
be eating a majority of my bandwidth and doing the server side
generation doesn&#8217;t give an etag or a last modified date, this makes
<a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers">conditional get</a>
broken when people try to fetch my feed.  Fortunately, Apache can
handle this stuff if I do a static file.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting sick of hacking up PyBlosxom, so I decided to do this
using some mod_rewrite voodoo and a cron job.  The first thing that
you&#8217;ll need is a cron job to periodically request the feed.  This is
how I have my entry:</p>

<pre><code>0 * * * * cd /home/patrick/Documents/www ; wget http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/index.rss --user-agent="Cacher" &gt; /dev/null ; if [ -f index.rss.1 ]; then mv index.rss.1 index.rss; fi
</code></pre>

<p>This fetches the feed once an hour and saves a copy in my root directory for
my web server.  You&#8217;ll notice that I tell WGet to use a special user agent
that I call &#8220;Cacher&#8221; to fetch the document.  Next we need some mod_rewrite
foo to change it all around.</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='apache'><span class='line'>       <span class="nb">RewriteCond</span> %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !Cacher
</span><span class='line'>            <span class="nb">RewriteRule</span> ^/weblog/index.rss <span class="sx">/index.rss</span> [L]
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This looks at the user agent of the request and sees if it is not
&#8220;Cacher&#8221;, if that is true, then it redirects silently to the cached
file.  Now, this may create some small delay in geting my feed
updated, but it should also reduce the overall bandwidth consumption
of my RSS feeds.  Sigh, just another sign I need to finish Priblog.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With marriage comes a lot of &#8220;firsts&#8221;.  We&#8217;re making a bit of an effort to
document some of these firsts so we can remember them for later.  On Friday,
the day after thanksgiving, Kristina and I put up our Christmas Tree.  I
purchased it last year on the day after Christmas for about $15 or so.  We&#8217;ve
got a whole series of photos that will eventually go up when I finish my
<a href="http://pennave.sf.net/">photo gallery software</a>.  But for right
now, you get to see the before and after pictures of our tree.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Frustrated by the fact that <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> doesn&#8217;t ship with NetApplet or
NetworkManager?  Me too!  In the true open source spirit, I&#8217;ve chosen
to get off my ass actually do something about it.  Behold, the first
screenshot of PyWifiApplet.  This little bugger sits on your gnome
panels and tells you what network you&#8217;re connected to.  It&#8217;s as
simple as just pulling up a menu to switch networks.  Can it get much
easier?  Well, yeah, it could detect the network switch automagically,
which is probably the next task.</p>

<p>Sittin in the Panel</p>

<p>Configuring the Applet</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s going to be a few more days until I get a chance
to clean up this thing and release it.  It makes use of the very handy
<a href="http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/pywifi/">pywifi</a> and the
python bindings for <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">dbus</a>
which allow communication to the server process that watches the network
configuration.  I think it might be a little debian specific right now, my
goal is to change that in the near future.</p>

<p>On a related Ubuntu note, I opened up my mail today to find that I had
received a package from Switzerland.  Thinking it was Anthrax, I was tempted
to have my wife open it, but she refused.  I was pleased to see a nice stack
of Ubuntu CDs.  I&#8217;ll go to the LUG meeting in a few weeks and give them
away there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/LI/BI/ALL/2003/0/HB0030.HTM">House Bill 30</a> is currently making it&#8217;s way through the Senate in the
state of Pennsylvania.  It seems like it&#8217;s a good thing, ecouraging investment
in broadband, supporting voice over IP, and that sort of stuff.  But a closer
read shows the whole think smacks of corporate interests.  In particular,
Section 3014, Subsection H (page 70 of the current version as of right now,
PN 4778) has the following:</p>

<pre><code> 3   (H) PROHIBITION AGAINST POLITICAL SUBDIVISION ADVANCED AND
 4 BROADBAND SERVICES DEPLOYMENT.--
 5     (1) EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR UNDER PARAGRAPH
 6   (2), A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OR ANY ENTITY ESTABLISHED BY A
 7   POLITICAL SUBDIVISION MAY NOT PROVIDE TO THE PUBLIC FOR
 8   COMPENSATION ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, INCLUDING
 9   ADVANCED AND BROADBAND SERVICES, WITHIN THE SERVICE TERRITORY
10   OF A LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OPERATING
11   UNDER A NETWORK MODERNIZATION PLAN.
12     (2) A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION MAY OFFER ADVANCED OR
13   BROADBAND SERVICES IF THE POLITICAL SUBDIVISION HAS SUBMITTED
14   A WRITTEN REQUEST FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH SERVICE TO THE
15   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY SERVING THE AREA
16   AND, WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST, THE LOCAL
17   EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES
18   HAS NOT AGREED TO PROVIDE THE DATA SPEEDS REQUESTED. IF THE
19   LOCAL EXCHANGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY OR ONE OF ITS
20   AFFILIATES AGREES TO PROVIDE THE DATA SPEEDS REQUESTED, THEN
21   IT MUST DO SO WITHIN 14 MONTHS OF RECEIPT OF THE REQUEST.
22     (3) THE PROHIBITION IN PARAGRAPH (1) SHALL NOT BE
23   CONSTRUED TO PRECLUDE THE CONTINUED PROVISION OR OFFERING OF
24   TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY A POLITICAL SUBDIVISION OF THE
25   SAME TYPE AND SCOPE AS WERE BEING PROVIDED ON THE EFFECTIVE
26   DATE OF THIS SECTION.
</code></pre>

<p>This would effectively kill <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20040901-4149.html">Philadelphia&#8217;s WiFi Plan</a>.  Why?  Because it&#8217;s bad news to
Verizon who would actually have to compete.  I see nothing wrong with a
&#8220;political subdivision&#8221; providing broadband services.  After all, if it&#8217;s a
free market, the local exchange companies would just have to provide better
service.  But I guess we all know that service and local exchange don&#8217;t go
together.  Anyway, I called <a href="http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/home/member_information/senate_bio.cfm?districtnumber=38">my state senator</a> about this already this morning.
The person who answered the phone was very helpful (much better than the
people I get at the federal level).  Let&#8217;s hope my phone call makes a
difference.  If I understand the current standing of the bill correctly, all that needs to be done is approval by
the senate and then a signature from Governor Rendell.  If you&#8217;re in PA and
get a chance, try to call today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve just finished working <a href="http://www.acm.org/cscw2004/">CSCW</a> at
the Chicago Hilton hotel.  My role there was as both as student volunteer and

attendees had network access and were able to connect to the Internet during
the main sessions to participate in back channel conversations.  My role as
a student volunteer was to help out whenever possible.  I didn&#8217;t need to do
a whole lot in that respect because most of my time was taken up by working on
the network issues.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s talk the original vision for the network.  Originally the conference
was going to provide wireless access in the Marquette room on the third floor
of the hotel for use as a email room.  We had a few computers that we rented
and were connected by a wired network to the internet.  Downstairs the main
sessions for the conference were to take place in the Continental ballrooms.
This was one large room that could be separated into three different rooms.
The original plan called for us to use the hotels wireless at their rather
exoborant rate.</p>

<p>However, that would have been far too easy.  A week before I was supposed to
arrive in Chicago, I received an email informing me that the hotel would be
unable to provide the wireless access we requested.  Furthermore the contact
for the hotel would not be in for the next few weeks (the email was
conventiently sent at 7pm on a Friday evening).  Furthermore,  I was also
informed that we now had to plan wireless access for another large ballroom
on Wednesday.  This was due to another failure on the part of the hotel as
they had &#8220;accidentally&#8221; given rooms we were contracted for to another group.
At first the thought was that I could probably just ignore the other room
and not provide access, then I was told that <a href="http://www.lessig.org/">Lessig&#8217;s</a>
talk would be in the new room.  Joy.</p>

<p>So, it went from being a very easy job to a rather difficult job.  I now needed
to plan a full network for 500 people in about four days.  Did I
mention I was really annoyed with the hotel by this point in time?
Well, if not, I was.</p>

<p>So, I got a hold of Jim on Saturday afternoon to discuss what we
should do.  The decision was made to give me the go ahead to purchase
whatever else I needed.  I estimated that on the low end I would need
about $700 worth of equipment to do the job and that on the high end I
would need about $2000.  It&#8217;s hard when you can&#8217;t say what the power
of the wireless signals will be or if you&#8217;re going need to buy a
computer to serve as a DHCP server or not.</p>

<p>I ended up just upping my original order a little bit.  I had
originally planned to order about 1000 feet of cable to wire whatever
I really needed to wire, along with a crimper and some heads.  I also
had already planned on getting four WRT54Gs and using those for the
bandwidth upstairs.  I just upped the order by three and picked up a
total of seven WRT54Gs.  In addition I ordered a 16 port wired switch
for the Internet room.  Total bill for all the equipment (cable,
crimper, heads, WRT54Gs, and switch) was just under $800.  I went with
CDW because they were local and if stuff started blowing up they had
same day delivery in downtown Chicago.  Plus, it wasn&#8217;t my money so I
wasn&#8217;t concerned about saving $3 a router by going with some obscure
website I had never heard of.</p>

<p>I arrived on Saturday morning and found that the equipment had arrived
without any difficulties.  Everything was there in nice little boxes.
Shortly after lunch time the tech from the hotel met me and we went to
turn on all of the internet jacks in each of the rooms.  Brian, the AV
chair went with me to make sure everythin went smoothly and to ensure
I remembered where everything was.  That afternoon I set up the
internet room.  I used two WRT54Gs for the room.  One was the primary
connection and the other just served as a switch/access point.  They
were put on two different frequencies, away from the Hilton&#8217;s
channels.  I also made the decision to use the custom <a href="http://www.sveasoft.com/">Sveasoft</a> firmware.  I&#8217;m not big on
the fact that the guy behind it seems to be a dick, but I run an old
version on my router and it seems to work well.  This just worked, no problem at all, it seems like everyone
was able to utilize everything just fine.</p>

<p>The next day I set up everything in the ballrooms downstairs.  I had
originally planned on doing one wireless network with a central DHCP
server that I would have to purchase.  However, due to Chicago fire
code, I was unable to do this as we&#8217;d have ethernet cable running
across a doorway or two, which is verboten in Chicago.  Instead I made
three different networks, each with a different SSID and on a
different channel.  Fearing that I would run out of IP addresses, I
limited the leases to 45 minutes.  Later this would come back and bite
me in the ass.</p>

<p>On Monday the conference began.  It was not pretty.  While some people
could get on the network just fine, others were having a horrible
time.  There were a couple of reasons that first day.  One reason was
just bandwidth.  I hadn&#8217;t blocked any services.  I did a little bit of
sniffing on the network and found that there were people doing
streaming video and BitTorrent.  At a conference you just can&#8217;t have
this sort of thing going on.  Luckily, the firmware has a layer 7
packet classifier that is able to block just those services without me
blocking the ports.  This helped out considerably.</p>

<p>But we still had the problem with people not being able to get IP
addresses.  It seemed like going up to the machines and rebooting them
&#8220;fixed&#8221; the problem.  In the sense that it allowed people to get IP
addresses, but it also sometimes caused address collisions.  People
seemed okay with the network at this point, but they weren&#8217;t happy.  I
decided to lower the lease time on the addresses, thinking that may
have had something to do with it.  So I dropped the time to 15
minutes, this only made the problem worse.  Sigh.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t get the problem figured out on Monday.  I could still
associate with the access points if I gave myself a static address,
but this was not practical for everyone.  Just to make sure that <a href="http://www.messyboard.org/">Messyboard</a> kept running, I ran a
200 foot ethernet cable to Adam&#8217;s display and gave him a couple of
static addresses.</p>

<p>Tuesday rolled around and I was able to pinpoint the problem down to
the DHCP server on the WRT54Gs dying.  There was pretty simple
solution to this, just put something in cron to automatically restart
the DHCP server.  The problem is where to put it.  Entries that were
put in crontab just seemed to disappear at random, they were not
reliable.  I found I could write a script and place the cron entry in
/etc/cron.d and that would do the trick.  However, if the machine was
rebooted then I would loose the script.  I made a copy of the script
on my disk and proceeded to put it on each of the machines.  It
worked like a charm.  I also realized that to minimize traffic on the
DHCP server I should put the lease time at 2 hours, as the is the
amount of time between sessions.  Important note for conference
planners, put your lease times at the length of time of the sessions
and no less.</p>

<p>Wednesday proved to be my biggest challenge.  There was session on
backchannel communication in the morning that <a href="http://www.interrelativity.net/">Joe</a> asked me to attend to
make sure everything worked fine.  I arrived down there early in the
morning to drop another access point in the room.  Both were set to
restart the DHCP server every 5 minutes.  Overall the backchannel
session worked like a charm.  The presenters were all in the
backchannel as were many people in the audience.  The two access
points were serving 120 different wireless devices at the same time
(70 on one, 50 on the other).  Yes, these little boxes kept going
after I fixed the DHCP issues.</p>

<p>The backchannel session was the most stressful, but also the most
rewarding.  After a while, I just stopped watching the routers because
I become comfortable in knowing that they were going to keep on
working.  Instead I just started searching for naughty pictures to
make <a href="http://mamamusings.net/">Liz Lawley&#8217;s</a> instance of
EtherPeg show funny stuff on the projector.</p>

<p>If I had it to do over, I would make a few changes.  First, I would
definately find a way to wire all the access points together.
Originally, this had been a possibility for us if I would have gotten
one of the wedge things that your put in a doorway and run cables
under.  This would have made everything much more seemless.  This
would have also required a computer to manage all the addresses.  A
little box from <a href="http://www.soekris.com/">Soekris</a> would
probably do the trick.  This would also allow me to create a larger
subnet, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about running out of addresses.
However, because we had to move upstairs on Wednesday, and thus the
conference was split between floors, this turned out to be a
non-option anyway.</p>

<p>The other thing I would do is give more thought to backchannel.  Most
importantly, mandate compensation for <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">FreeNode</a> as part of the deal.
They are great folks and really helped us out a lot.  Secondly, get a
bot that is able to post the logs and an archive of the links on a web
page.  Lots of people have asked for the logs, which have <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/research/cscw/">been posted</a> to
my webpage.  I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the need for a wiki during
the conference, but post conference, it seems like it would have been
helpful.  During the conference it was great to have Messyboard
running in a highly visible location.  I can&#8217;t stress that enough.</p>

<p>Finally, one last thought is that it might be nice to have a <a href="http://planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> style weblog aggregator for
people who are blogging at the conference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Both of these are courtesy of <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>.
The first is that someone went and made a KILLER <a href="http://www.greyvideo.com/">video of Encore</a> from <a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html">The Grey Album</a>.  Great creativity lies in this video.  Ringo starts
spinnin and John starts break dancing.  If the video goes down (waiting for
the C&amp;D&#8217;s to start flying) I can probably find a site that has it an hook you
up with it.</p>

<p>The second is the very cool remix from <a href="http://www.kleptones.com/">The

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The TSA seems to be rolling ahead with the horribly named &#8220;Secure Flight&#8221;
program that will do nothing to protect us.  As more evidence, I received
the following email today on the IP list:</p>

<blockquote><p>U.S. Airlines Must Supply Travel Records by Nov. 23, U.S. Says</p></blockquote>

<p>2004-11-12 11:59 (New York)</p>

<blockquote><p>By John Hughes</p>

<p>Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) &#8211; U.S. airlines were ordered to hand
 over records of all passengers who flew domestically in June so
 the government can test a new system aimed at keeping terrorists
 off airplanes. Carriers must comply by Nov. 23.</p>

<pre><code>  The records of the 72 carriers including AMR Corp.'s
</code></pre>

<p> American Airlines and UAL Corp.&#8217;s United Airlines include names,
 addresses and itineraries, the Transportation Security
 Administration said in an order today. The agency will compare
 the passengers against government watchlists in a 30-day test of
 the program called Secure Flight, slated to begin next year.</p>

<pre><code>  The program ``would identify passengers known or reasonably
</code></pre>

<p> suspected to be engaged in terrorist activity,&#8221; said the order
 signed by privacy officer Lisa Dean, and &#8220;prevent them from
 boarding a domestic flight.&#8221;</p>

<pre><code>  The government plans to replace the existing screening
</code></pre>

<p> system since terrorists boarded four commercial jets in the Sept.
 11 attacks that killed 2,749. The government dropped a planned
 earlier version called CAPPS II after privacy groups complained.
 Privacy advocates also asked the government to suspend the new
 version until more information on its workings can be disclosed.</p>

<p>&#8211;Editor: Simenhoff</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, normally this wouldn&#8217;t bother me much, as I don&#8217;t fly all that much, but
I did fly during the month of June, which causes me some concern, because this
means that my information will be handed over to the TSA.  Furthermore, I have
no idea of knowing what information will be handed over.  Figuring that trying
something is better than doing nothing, I decided to give Continental a call
at 1-800-We-Care-2, which is their customer service number.</p>

<p>I calmly explained the situation to the representative on the phone and
explained that I wanted to know what of my information they were handing over
to the TSA.  Her response was that it was Continental&#8217;s policy to hand over
any and all information that the TSA asks for.  I then inquired how this related
to their privacy policy, she again stated that it was their policy to turn over
any and all information that the TSA asks for.  This wasn&#8217;t going anywhere fast.</p>

<p>Explaining that I understood that was Continentals position, I asked if they
were going to notify their customers that they were violating their privacy
policy.  She said no.  I asked why not.  She cited security related issues.
Yeah right.  I then asked what of my information was going to be handed over to
the TSA.  She said &#8220;Continental does not have that information&#8221;.  This seems
like clearly the lady wasn&#8217;t understanding or was crazy, most likely the former.
I asked how they were able to hand over information they didn&#8217;t have.  She said
that they would comply with any TSA request.  Then I asked for a collection of
what information they had on me.  She said they could not release that for
security reasons.  That&#8217;s probably a good thing, they shouldn&#8217;t be giving out
information like that over the telephone.</p>

<p>At this point the lady began to get combative and said that there was no way
that we could figure out what information the government has on us.  I told her
about our ability to FOIA our records and said that I was prepared to do that
for the information obtained by the TSA.  She said that if I wanted to get
anywhere I would need to call the TSA about this.  Their phone number is
1-866-289-9673.  It seemed like this must be a frequent question because she
quickly provided me with their email and postal address too.</p>

<p>It again asked how calling the TSA could get me information that Continental
had not yet turned over to the federal government.  She said that&#8217;s all she
could say.  Then she changed drastically and said that Continental had not
received notice of what information they were required to turn over, which is
a non-truth, as I&#8217;m sure they have.  She also said that it was uncertain whether
or not Continental was going to turn over information at all.  Which was
a direct contradiction of what she previously said.  She also started talking
about how she was a consumer and was concerned about this and how she thought
there was nothing she could do.  I told her that I was fighting back and that
she should to.  Alas, she seemed resigned to having big brother watch over her.
After all, she works for the airline, so there is nothing she could do.</p>

<p>Moving on, I thanked the lady and picked up the phone to call the TSA.  The
operator on the line had a poor command of English and almost sounded like she
was outsourced, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case.  I explained the situation
of how I was concerned about secure flight.  At first she thought that I wanted
to report a security issue on a flight.  No, I do not.  I want to know what
information the government is collecting on me.  I tried again, using smaller
words and she appeared to understand this time; or at the very least realized
that this was outside her realm.  She then asked that I leave my name and number
and someone would call me back later.  So I did, but I left my work number.
If I don&#8217;t hear from someone by the end of the semester I&#8217;m gonna FOIA my
records and see what fun they hold inside.</p>

<p>Fight the power!  You should try this too!  It&#8217;s a fun activity for a Saturday
morning!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was in Chicago this last week and noticed that the nice folks at the
<a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> have started up a bit of an advertising
campaign to education people on the problems with downloading movies.  Here is
the ad, and my commentary follows.</p>

<p>[</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/resources/images/blog/mpaaIntimidation_thumb.jpg" alt="Full size MPAA Intimidation Ad" /></p>

<p>Full Size MPAA Initimdation Ad</p>

<p>](/resources/images/blog/mpaaIntimidation.jpg)[</p>

<p><img src="/weblog/resources/images/blog/mpaaIntimidation2_thumb.jpg" alt="MPAA Intimidation Text" /></p>

<p>MPAA Intimidation Text</p>

<p>](/resources/images/blog/mpaaIntimidation2.jpg)</p>

<p>My initial thought was that whoever actually made this ad for them should be
shot.  This does not treat the people they&#8217;re addressing as customers.  Instead
it reuses the failed strategy of the RIAA in assuming that everyone is a thief.
Calling people thiefs will not make them your friend.   Now, to the MPAA&#8217;s
credit, they actually make a decent product but I digress.  They also fail to
make the distinction between the legal downloading of movies and the illegal
downloading of movies.   Many movies are available free on the internet from
sites such as <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the Internet Archive</a>.
In any case, this appears to be the first salvo in a war that MPAA cannot
possibly win.  If they pursue this path they will end up just as hated as the
RIAA.  While there has been some bright spots in hollywood, much of hollywood
is becoming boring sequels.  Furthermore, they&#8217;ll soon begin to feel more of
the wrath of copyright clearance from the broken system.  Oh to be an
independent nation.</p>

<p>As a bit of an aside, the MPAA has a copy of their print <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/CurrentReleases/IsThisYou_Ad.pdf">intimidation ad</a> available online.</p>
