<div style="padding: 5px; margin: 5px; border: 1px solid #f77; background-color: #fcc"><b>Important:</b> This is my personal home page.  If you're looking
for information about my research or academic pursuits, please see my <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/">academic home page</a>
at <a href="http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/">http://academic.patrick.wagstrom.net/</a> and bookmark that page instead.  It's much
better organized for folks interested in my work.  This page contains lots of information about my life when I'm not working.

This is the requisite bit of information about me.  I'm a 29 year old graduate
student in the <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/">Department of Engineering and
Public Policy</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon
University</a>.  I'm currently looking at various aspects of software policy,
specifically related to open source software and community creation.  But that's
subject to change.  In addition to what I look at for research, I'm also
interested in various issues related to liberty and technology and follow
debates on the PATRIOT act, HDTV broadcast flag, and politics in general.

<p>
I moved to Pittsburgh in August 2003 after spending six years in Chicago.
There I attended <a href="http://www.iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of
Technology</a> where I attained bachelors of science degrees in Computer
Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and a masters of science
degree in Computer Science.  While there I did a number of interesting things,
such as working for <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/">Argonne National
Laboratory</a>, managing the computer systems for an <a
href="http://www.lecltd.com">advertising agency</a>, worked for a <a
href="http://www.mypoints.com/">startup</a>, and other assorted mayhem.  </p>
<p>
Among other interesting facts is that I was recently married to <a href="http://kristina.wagstrom.net/">Kristina Felfe</a>.  You can find lots of pictures from
it up on our <a href="/gallery/">photos</a> page.  A bit of a recap can be found
on <a href="http://wedding.wagstrom.net/">wedding.wagstrom.net</a>.

He're a brief overview of what's on my site.  First, my most popular documents:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In January of 2006, I was <a href="http://digg.com/linux_unix/MythTV%2C_Ubuntu%2C_Athlon64%2C_PVR-250%2C_Comcast_Digital_Cable%2C_and_a_pcHDTV">Dugg</a> for my
<a href="/tutorials/mythTV64/mythTV64.xml">Ubuntu x86_64 MythTV Tutorial</a>.  It still is a work in progress, that I update periodically.</li>
	<li>I get a pretty good amount of steady traffic from my <a href="/tutorials/pygtkmozembed/pygtkmozembed.html">PyGTK and Mozilla tutorial</a>.  It's a little out
of date by now though.</li>
	<li>Back in 2003 I was <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/24/1423205&amp;tid=96&amp;tid=194">slashdotted</a> for my writeup on how to <a href="/old/weblog/archives/000129.html">hack Unix lpd to play mp3 files</a>.</li>
	<li>And on the academic geek pride level, I'm linked from the <a href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix home page</a> for my old writeup on how to manage <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/projects/academic/cs551/minix.php">Minix under VMWare</a>.  This got me personal emails from the author of Minix</li>
	<li>Finally, if you'd like to know what I'm up to, feel free to check out my <a href="/weblog/">wonderful weblog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For other stuff, feel free to check out the links at the side of the pages.  One of these days I'm gonna hook all this up to a nifty scripting thing, but I really don't
have time to do that right now.  If you have comments, feel free to email me.
