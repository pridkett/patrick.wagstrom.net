As most of my readers know, before migrating to Pittsburgh, I lived in Chicago for
six years.  It's a great city to live in and their parks are wonderful.  While in
Chicago, I paid my share of city taxes.  I'm sure some of my money went to help
build Millenium Park, which was supposed to be open in 2000, but didn't open up
until 2004.  I got a chance to see it in November when I was in town for CSCW.

Well, it turns out, it's illegal for me to photograph "The Bean", even
though my tax dollars paid for it and it's in a public space.  You can
read all about it how
[The Bean is copyrighted Public Space](http://newurbanist.blogspot.com/2005/01/copyrighting-of-public-space.html).
I don't think that Anish Kapoor, the artist behind The Bean,
understands copyright law. Here's some of my pictures of the bean.  If you'd like
the 3.2 megapixel ones let me know.

Yes, you can feel free to profit off these just to piss Anish Kapoor
off.
