My GRExperience

<p>
Today I arose at 6:20am to take the GRE, for the second time.  I think I could write pages and pages about the people who were in the waiting room in Prometric at 20 N Clark, but I don't have the time.  Needless to say it was some interesting people watching.  Anyway, I did it, I raised my score 60 points, I'm not sure if it was worth $100, but I can hope it was.  Now it's time to start thinking about Graduate Schools again.  Time to beg for letters of recommendation.  Time to write more essays.  Joy of Joys.
