  <h1>Wine About the Election</h1>
  <p>Once every four years Americans have a civic duty to travel to their local polling place, pick between the several candidates, each of which
    is perfectly capable letting down everyone who voted for them by not implementing anything they said they would.  What's the only solution?  Wine about the election.  We invite all those interested to please come and "Wine" about the election on Tuesday, November 4th from 7:30pm - 1am (sorry folks, I'm not staying up all night like I did in 2000 and 2004).  Here's all the information you need to know:
    </p>
  <p><b>Your polling place is at:</b> 3938 Nantasket St, Pittsburgh, PA 15207 (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=109387145110095184462.000439f4d83d9678e926c&t=h&z=16">map</a>)<br/>
    <b>The polls are open from:</b> 7:30pm on November 4th, 2008 - 1:00am on November 5th, 2008<br/>
    <b>Voter Hotline:</b> If you have questions please contact one of the election judges.  Either Patrick (412-606-9730, <a href="mailto:patrick@wagstrom.net">patrick@wagstrom.net</a>) or Kristina (412-606-1633, <a href="mailto:kristina@wagstrom.net">kristina@wagstrom.net</a>)<br/>
    <b>To vote you must:</b> Register to vote (see form at the bottom of this page)<br/>
    <b>Requirements for entering the polling place:</b> Proper classy attire for wine-ing about the election is required of all those entering the polling place.  All guests are encouraged to bring items consistent with the party they registered with.  So, if you're bringing soda, register as a prohibitionist, white wine should be "chilled whites", etc.<br/>
    <b>Deadline for registration:</b> We allow day of and on-site registration.  We prefer that, if possible, guests register no later than November 2nd, 2008.<br/>
    <b>Access to voter rolls:</b> All interested individuals may <a href="rolls.cgi">examine the voter rolls</a> to verify that they are registered and to see who else is registered.  In the interest of creating a balanced event and avoiding a two-party system, new individuals may wish to examine the rolls before registering.<br/>
    <b>Avoiding politics:</b> We'll have the TV on covering results upstairs, while downstairs will be a no-spin zone if you just want to avoid that stuff.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
    As a final note, all individuals of all political persuasions may wine about the election -- unless you voted for Nader in Florida in 2000.  While wine-ing about the election is a non-partisan event, the election judges do have their preference in candidates, and may get mopey or ecstatice depending on if said candidate wins or loses.  We ask that individuals please refrain from wearing articles of clothing for political candidates, unless it's something kitchy, like an "I like Ike" button -- of course, your pitted out Wellstone '90 t-shirt is not appropriate attire for wine-ing about the election.
  </p>
  <div style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; background-color: #fcc; border: 2px solid red; padding: 1ex;"><b>Election Pick'em:</b> To give people a little more to do, I've put up a form where you can try your hand at picking which candidate will win each state.  Go <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=p27PynhRt2jz--B-yKKqWQA">fill out the form</a> and pick between undecided, Obama, and McCain.  The winner will be determined by the election results at Midnight.  All responses must be received by 5:00pm on Tuesday, November 4th to be entered.</div>
  <div style="margin-left: 4em; margin-right: 4em; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em; background-color: #fcc; border: 2px solid red; padding: 1ex;"><b>Clarification:</b> So, trying to be all coy with the theme has caused a few problems, so here's the non-coded instructions.  Fill out the form below to RSVP for the party, include other folks on the "Other Individuals" line.  The party registration is used to indicate what you're going to bring to the party.  Also, this is a wine tasting/party, so we ask that people dress appropriately for such an event.  Don't worry, it confused Kristina too.</div>

              <div id="platformRed">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1822<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> Napa Valley, CA<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Skye Goodsun<br/>
The American Red Traditionalist Party represents the values of real Americans.  All Americans should have access to the original wine - red wine, perfectly constructed to compliment fine American foods such as steak and pork.  We also are concerned about the environment and believe that our wines should never be chilled, saving energy that other parties waste through refrigerators and ice buckets.</div>

              <div id="platformWhite">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1904<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> Salem, OR<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Brad Kulongowski<br/>
The Chilled Whites party reflects the values of Americans who realize we can no longer be isolated in the world.  Our rampant consumption of beef and pork has led to increased greenhouse gas emissions and sped up global warming.  We believe Americans want a wine that goes well with lighter fare such as chicken and fish, and is best served cold.</div>

              <div id="platformOther">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1972<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> Niagara Falls, NY<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Herbert Lefebvre<br/>The Fruit, Rose, and Ice Coalition believes that wine has been locked between the major parties for too long.  There are so many other opportunities for wine, particularly with sweeter wines, such as wines made from berries that make an excellent desert.  We are the only party that represents the diversity of the American people.</div>
              <input type="radio" name="party" value="cheese"/><a onClick="togglePlatform('Cheese');">Wisconsin Dairy Farmers Union</a><br/>
              <div id="platformCheese">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1888<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> LaCrosse, WI<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Hiram D. Johnson III<br/>Americans cannot live on wine alone!  The Wisconsin Dairy Farmers Union recognizes the value of wine but believes it must be supported with other foods, such as high quality cheese and delicious crackers.  We support all kinds of sides to go with all wines and believe we must form a coalition government for optimal taste.</div>
              <input type="radio" name="party" value="prohibition"/><a onClick="togglePlatform('Prohibition')">Pennsylvanian Prohibitionist Party</a><br/>
              <div id="platformProhibition">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1908<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> Dover, PA<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Jebedaiah West<br/>For too long the scourge of wine has led to the wine-o on American streets.  The Pennsylvanian Prohibitionist Party believes we must cease from drinking wine and switch to beverages which posess none of the devil's liquid, such as soda, water, and juices of fruits and vegetables!  Unite for a pure tomorrow!</div>
              <input type="radio" name="party" value="driver"/><a onClick="togglePlatform('Driver')">Americans United For Transportation</a><br/>
              <div id="platformDriver">
<b>Date Founded:</b> 1992<br/>
<b>Headquarters:</b> Detroit, MI<br/>
<b>Party Secretary:</b> Alfred Ford<br/>
Americans have become too divided.  All the major parties seek to supress the vote of the other parties. The only goal of Americans United For Transportation is to ensure that all those participating in elections are able to safely reach both the polling place and their destination after voting.  We willingly offer services to both close and new friends and pledge to stay away from alcohol on election day.  In exchange, we promise to bring nothing to the polling place.</div>
