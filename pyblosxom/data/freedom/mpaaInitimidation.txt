MPAA Intimidation

I was in Chicago this last week and noticed that the nice folks at the 
<a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA</a> have started up a bit of an advertising
campaign to education people on the problems with downloading movies.  Here is
the ad, and my commentary follows.

My initial thought was that whoever actually made this ad for them should be
shot.  This does not treat the people they're addressing as customers.  Instead
it reuses the failed strategy of the RIAA in assuming that everyone is a thief.
Calling people thiefs will not make them your friend.   Now, to the MPAA's
credit, they actually make a decent product but I digress.  They also fail to
make the distinction between the legal downloading of movies and the illegal
downloading of movies.   Many movies are available free on the internet from
sites such as <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the Internet Archive</a>.
In any case, this appears to be the first salvo in a war that MPAA cannot
possibly win.  If they pursue this path they will end up just as hated as the
RIAA.  While there has been some bright spots in hollywood, much of hollywood
is becoming boring sequels.  Furthermore, they'll soon begin to feel more of
the wrath of copyright clearance from the broken system.  Oh to be an
independent nation.

As a bit of an aside, the MPAA has a copy of their print <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/CurrentReleases/IsThisYou_Ad.pdf">intimidation ad</a> available online.
